One empty, interminable morning shift, as hunger’s billow bloomed below ribs in a squelching hollow of circular disquiet, the worker reached to pocket to retrieve a chocolate bar, a nougat and caramel filled lump, whose body-softened warmth lay nestled beyond keys, beyond change and was soon clasped, its foil wrapping diligently unpeeled to denude the contents to sight, which upon confrontation, upon immediate inspection appeared to twitch, shifting spontaneously, magically moving and tossing and writhing in hand to smear its fatty brown residue from finger to wrist, eventually wriggling free of the worker’s clutch to stand, its first unbroken square positioned parallel to the worker’s face, static before speaking mouthlessly in a calm and measured metre, “I have seen your future, worker, your life in its complete, unbroken arc from death unto now, and I know you will parent a child, a delicate and beautiful enfant, whose genesis will induce ecstatic, joyous weeping in the rapture of cosmic gratitude; yet those tears will fall selfishly, for your child will never attain a happiness equal to yours, not once; rather, they will suffer and only suffer, tortured each hour in acute and enduring pain, an enduring stinging through which anguish constricts every breath, the cruelties augmented by mental torment, by persistent, unchanging depression, anxiety and guilt, engorged with mockeries, beatings and abuses, which will neither be disclosed nor intimated to you, their misery obscured in selfless deference to parents whose pride and contentment they will wish to maintain; yet, still, they will hope for death, always, insistently, and upon your eventual delayed expiration they, too, will seek theirs and die, relieved, not pleased, only dead,” and thus, with their prophesy delivered the chocolate bar fell silent, hardening to a cold, inanimate lump lain flat upon the worker’s palm, its firm mass neither desirable nor edible nor disposable, merely present,

And so, overcome with a shiversome urge to defecate and distractedly shifting weight between feet, hopping from heel to ball in an odd circular motion, as if dancing to an inaudible rhythm, the worker strode briskly bathroomwards, hurriedly approaching the toilet before loosening belt and trousers, pausing briefly as they cleaned the seat, unspooling paper, whereupon, with loose leaves scrunched lightly in hand, they registered a soft, muffled cough rise from the bowl, from a pool of fetid amber broth in which a frayed finger-length stool rocked rhythmically to the plumbing’s current, swaying silently whilst a wheezing emerged, a small mouth protruding from the faecal lump, making faintly visible two parting lips, puckered and wrinkled such that the worker leant fearfully forward to look at the shit, and the shit looked at the worker, and clamly, sonorously the excrement spoke, “You are loved, you are loved deeply and lastingly, and you are loved irrespective of that which you have done, or of that which you have thought; it matters not what selfishness nor wickedness nor cowardice have elapsed, nor what thoughts have lingered in your deepest, saddest loathings, for I love you and I will love you forever: I will never cease to love you, and so all doubt, all fear and loneliness ought now to subside, the competitive, toxic dissatisfaction and your disappointments ought too to recede, for you are not alone, you are mine; I am with you always, in darkness and in light, in anguish and in joy, for all eternity, you are loved” and thus, with a final smile spread across the stool’s indistinct countenance, a silence ensued, the ordure’s mouth vanishing, leaving the worker alone, perturbed and dumbfounded no longer inclined to defecate, pensive as they refastened their belt to depart, 

And at that moment the worker felt an itch surface from their forearm in an erratic, tingling prickle that danced from wrist to elbow, shifting a blotched discomfort across the limb, prompting them to raise their sleeve and apprehend a red speckled rash last allayed some weeks ago and now recrudescent, manifest in a dispersed constellation of scarlet spots, each contrastive and tender, raised in hemispherical bumps and felt as the worker ran fingers thereover, gingerly tracing the contours of every scale-like mound, every pimple, before the flecks ostensibly moved, slowly migrating and rapidly amassing in a cluster of red dots that shifted inwards, their distribution centrifugally, speedily rotating, to assemble in a solid coalescent core whose vivid centre gleamed lucent and enlivened, shining a bright crimson, mysteriously pulsating as it spoke, releasing a deep stentorian tenor, “Your silent thoughts, your unspoken clandestine moments of brilliant insight, which have hitherto lay hidden from the world, which have gone unspoken, whose powers of revelation have been thought lost, deemed only as your own, as pointless discoveries, in a subterranean world-disclosing poetry that was never recognised by others and forever suppressed in its limitless potential, has not been for nought; no, I have seen and have heard each internal proposition ensconced or released, and I know the enduring genius thereof, for there is no ideal realm, no corner of mentality I cannot apprehend, such that I have seen too your kindest thoughts, your unique epiphanies and your altruistic concerns, your caring, committed cogitations that have never been recognised, and I know that you are good, you are good and you are great,” and thus the rash again disaggregated, returning to its previous dispersed condition, leaving only those final words to resound,

And so the worker looked to the floor, where whilst vainly searching for distractive intrigue they spotted a cockroach, walking towards their shoes, scuttling such that the worker instinctively raised their feet to elude contact, yet as they did, as they hovered knees above seat, suspended as if part of an odd exercise routine, the insect curled its back to stand erect on hind legs, “Behold, I am God, I am the almighty, your companion and creator,” it said, “and today I bring instructions to which you must adhere: you are to end your life, you are to die prematurely by your own hand and by a means of your choosing; whether through suffocation or drowning, through overdose or hanging, the method matters not, but you must die of your own volition, as indubitable proof of your faith in me, and when you do, salvation shall be yours, yours shall be the eternal glories of paradise, the riches of enlightenment, the fulfilment of fantasy; yet, if you fail, if you die otherwise, through age or illness or accident, you shall not reach heaven but eternal damnation, and torture shall be yours, for you will suffer the smouldering agonies of hell; and so your fate remains your own, to be chosen and enacted or not, and that is final,” and thus the cockroach returned to its forelegs and scurried back from the worker, beyond sight,

Then creeping from vision’s limit the worker spotted an electric flicker release from a dangled, exposed tungsten bulb, registered at eyesight’s fringe, glinting on, off, on, off, as if relaying some Morse-coded message, opaque to the worker yet enticing, prompting their approach, whereupon strolling, after gingerly placing foot before foot, they noticed each momentary flash of light was extending with proximity, brightening such that increasingly sustained illuminations lingered as their distance diminished, the flash slowing until once underneath, once ensconced in direct irradiation, the fulguration ceased, transitioning to a steady and severe glow from which a light, sonorous voice cascaded, “Worker, I have heard your wretched thoughts, the silent, internal, dark ruminations concocted when alone and with others, at dawn and at midnight, with contents you have hitherto kept private, with words and images contained and sealed, buried to the world, as if your clandestine hoard or retreat whose wickedness and cruelty you thought yours and yours alone, yet they have not remained so, for I have registered each repugnant cogitation, each gruesome proposition, apprehending their entirety, spectator to the malicious desires that pullulate in your longings for violence, to be wreaked upon individual and nation, in your perverse relish in tragedy, in the giddy excitement gleaned upon market crash, upon famine and war, with your spite and jealousy, too, bestowed on loved ones and enemies in wishes for revenge and illness, in fantasises of misery and sickness, death and dereliction, through which you have envisaged your gain from loss and satisfaction in strife; I have observed your scheming and selfish ideas, your lies, your manipulative schemes, plotted for the most meagre of benefits, and, whilst these thoughts have come to nought, neither realised nor enacted, stymied by conscience, reflection or cowardice, they have existed, and remain resistant to willed erasure, because as much as you might imagine these thoughts hidden, in your projected boundary between thought and action, their banks have burst: the darkness of your mind has extend outwards, and I have seen, your thoughts not only your own and you are not only you,” and there a silence enveloped the worker, the bulb dimming, fading to a dark inanimacy as they watched the hot filament dwindle to blackness, the two mute thereafter,

And thus the worker raised their ribs to inhale, breathing purposefully, meditatively, as if to expunge the unwanted stertorous thoughts of morning, lifting diaphragm and shoulders before a dull ache rose from their foot, diffusing upwards to beget a sense of cumbrous heft, persistent and painful, such that they looked to foot and noticed a vague limpness, which they sought to inspect, bending their knee to rest shoe on thigh before hunching to examine the pain that plagued their lower limb, throbbing on each side as they placed a hand thereupon, where on contact a crack issued forth and the foot thudded heavily to ground, severed, the shoe and contents strewn yards from their leg, with feather-like strands of desiccated tissue left protruding from its sock, which the worker examined in horror until, suddenly, the shoe appeared to rise, uprighting, bouncing, twice, as an adenoidal wheeze spluttered forth, “Worker, know that I have seen your actions, I have seen your life’s every movement, your daily practice now registered in its aggregate, and please know that each sinful indulgence, each thoughtless trespass has been registered, for I have seen your deceptions and lies, your everyday manipulative excuses and self-interested distortions and their consequences, and I have, too, seen your infidelities, undertaken in the confidence that the immediacies of gratification outweigh the faithful investments of others, as their hurt and sadness burgeoned whilst you failed to repent and transform, as you continued your meanness, proliferating insults and supercilious condescension, prejudice and denigration, degrading friends, strangers and loved ones to assuage your doubts, a reservoir of self-loathing debouched into blameless waters, and know that this cancerous totality of wretchedness has been understood and persists, ineradicably in the world,” and there the foot suddenly regained its moisture and leapt from the floor to return to its limb, lighter and painless, voiceless as the worker stood static, 

And thus the worker placed hand to brow, running clammy digits across each deepened furrow, slowly edging at their temple until they registered a faint muttering noise vibrate against skin, whereupon they froze in concentration, pausing, whilst the low murmur continued, manifest as a persistent mumbling pitch that appeared to radiate from their finger, which they withdrew to inspect, seeing that a small bleach-white cicatrix below their nail had opened and was moving, closed and shut, dilating to reveal deeper tissue, the once-sealed wound woken and speaking so that worker thrust the scar to their ear to apprehend its soliloquy, hearing, “I remember gifts given to friends, I remember sacrifices made for family, I remember inconveniences made for strangers, I remember burdens borne for siblings, I remember labours expended for colleagues, I remember pains suffered for lovers, I remember compromises made for cohabiters, I remember taxes paid for services, I remember embarrassments suffered for kindness, I remember donations made to charities, I remember hours given for political struggle, I remember interventions ventured for justice, I remember speeches uttered for greater goods, I remember each and every act of virtue undertaken in life thus far,” the wound there falling silent, its message delivered and the fleshly chasm closed and motionless, serenely facing the worker who momentarily gasped before walking onwards, elsewhere,

And there the worker crouched, overcome with a back pain acquired days previously, unremedied and worsening, the upshot of labour’s slouch, which, unabated, prompted a stretch of the hips for alleviation, through the temporary palliation of muscular flex, the ache running from back to buttocks, yet with their groin opened, widening gradually and therapeutically, they felt vibrations issue from their pocket, sending a hand therein to search for phone, but upon retrieval of its contents they found only cash, notes and coins whose graphic insignia were strangely, inexplicably moving, automatically miming, their mouths moving in unison, inaudibly, “Should you desire unending life, should you fear death and seek finitude’s transcendence, wanting only to endure in perpetuity without thought of closure, of fatality or the long declivity to cessation, then such shall be yours, worker; yet to grasp immortality you must change: you must renounce sexual pleasure in every myriad guise: you must neither kiss nor caress another, nor imagine so doing, nor must you masturbate; you must not touch your body to elicit sensual enjoyments of any sort – neither stroking nor clenching nor penetrating yourself – and you must not look lustfully upon others; you must banish each concupiscent thought, you must not envisage unclothed bodies, others’ swollen genitals or coital contortions, nor must you imagine others looking upon you, whether with desirous or other intent that begets gratification; you must resist every temptation to lubricious gesture, every inclination to provoke the lasciviousness of strangers, and you must not divert your sexual urges, fantasies and impulses to non-human objects; rather you must seek not to displace sensuous longing but eradicate it, because sexuality, whatever that shifting, unpredictable form might be, diffuse and ever changing, must end; you must maintain your distance or you will die,” and then the markings halted, returning to lifeless, frozen form, upon which the worker gazed for five minutes, hoping to spy flinch or movement whereby the cash might resume talking, to issue clarification or repetition, a mere confirmation of their previous animacy in repudiation of doubt, yet they did not; they did nothing, leaving the worker to return money to pocket gingerly, left with little option other than to continue their day,

And with their hand on waist, their thumb settled firmly on belt and fingers dangling flaccidly down, the worker sensed a ripple spread through their genitalia, in a tingling, shivering sensation that soon subsided, but which moments later recommenced, palpitating, compelling their further enquiry, leading them to scan their surroundings and look in all directions until once confidently unsurveilled, once certain of visual solitude, they dropped a hand inside their underwear, their fingertips wandering from pelvis to edge of their urethra, tracing the orifice’s contours as they felt an opening and retraction, in a series of goldfish-like gulps, each mandibular flex releasing a mellow euphonious note, a soft mellifluous song unfolding, “There must be no more writing, no more inscription: words must no longer spill needlessly from incontinent pens nor must digits stab blindly at keyboards, at phones or touchpads, typing their compulsions to appease the world’s conceptual hunger, the world’s determinative thirst for inscription, for ever more voluminous, ever more detailed significations; for silence’s sake these must remain unslaked, without sentences, paragraphs, pages, without the momentary designations that constrain affect and intuition in names, in directions and imperatives; rather, the texts that attenuate experience must diminish, and the engorged world of letters must expand no further; you must deprive this malignant, tumescent growth of fuel, you must starve its swollen belly with reticence, with refusal, with a mute resolve to forgo communication and confine thought to its rightful inner realm,” and thus without further valediction, without hint of warning, the genitalia fell silent, still, as the worker pondered how best to respond 

and there, with neither warning nor discernible origin, a thick breeze rolled upon the worker, first tickling their ears and fingertips, pleasantly cooling each exposed extremity, then wafting stronger, gaining force and speed, intensifying, blowing faster and heavier to surge with the weight of an implacable wave that pressed clothes to bone and pushed them staggering back, their shoulders caved to bear the heft, hearing, as they did, a slew of sibilant words surfing on the gale’s crest, declaiming, “worker, you will be poorer tomorrow than you are today; you will be poorer the day after than you were then, and you will be poorer the week beyond and the year beyond that, because every minute of your life will see your wealth diminish, your money and possessions evanesce, dwindling to a previously uncountenanced scope, depriving you of house, of holiday, of furniture and transport, and, when you feel your poverty has reached its lowest, you will nevertheless fall poorer still, you will forgo meals and sociality, you will find your clothes reduced to fetid rags, threadbare and stinking, you will barter and downgrade, plead and beg, plunging to the depths of desperation, seeking to sell whatever you can, your possessions and heirlooms, your labours and commitments, you will offer performances, degradations, sexual services to alleviate your misery, abandoning your body to remunerating subjugation, but your despoiled pleas will fall rebuffed, for you will have grown so malnourished, so decayed that you repulse and disgust passers-by, whom will recoil from your sallow flesh and carious maw, seeking to rid themselves of the rotten squalor, of your leprous, carbuncular flesh, such that you will reside alone in pathetic indigence, left only to contemplate misfortune, your ill-health and complete ruination, destitute and waning until you die,” and upon the final evocation of mortality the noise, the wind, the incantation and its prophecy ceased, causing the worker to lurch forward, their face and hands tingling, thoughts awhirl,

const first = ["Morning had elapsed in crisp, hibernal condition with neither event nor incident to speak of, and it appeared as though afternoon would unfold likewise, in the steady crunch of productivity;", 
"Customer service employees were required to respond to external enquiries within forty eight hours; a single non-observance constituted grounds for discipline, consistent failure, a basis for dismissal,",
"One cool Autumn evening, upon the end of an unremarkable working day, the worker lumbered to their usual bus shelter and leant against a cold, crimson advertisement, where, drowsy and stiff, they noticed that five yards or so from their feet lay the bloodied and limp carcass of a cat, which they supposed had been wounded by a car and had shambled to the edge of the thoroughfare and had died, such that it now sat slumped – outstretched and parallel to the kerb – several inches from a steady stream of traffic that pressed past the filthy creature, whose fur had grown greasy and ringletted with an amalgam of blood and muck and fat, and whose abdomen exhibited a finger length perforation, opening the pinkish jelly and carmine scabs of its laceration to the dusky air, releasing clods of viscera to slop and nestle between the tarmac and the animal’s soft, ivory belly, on which the hair was overgrown and thick, or was so relative to that on its hind legs, which had thinned and been dirtied with a mixture of sticky burgundy and chestnut gore and was dotted with a business of plump flies, attracted to the stench of the corpse; though the worker, from their present distance, could not smell it but could only discern the insects’ movements, watching as they fizzed with the vibrations of freight in the leftmost lane, insistent until one particularly heavy automobile scattered them, sending the flies apart and upwards, signalling that the bus that was to collect the worker had arrived and that they were to be ferried from this public realm of foulness and labour to a private realm of home, where they could forget their job and would be free to do whatsoever they pleased,",
"The worker, who would in future acquire employment in advertising, awoke one weekday morning to find themselves late for college, and though under such circumstances they would ordinarily rush to the bathroom, bladder bloated and sagging, today they wallowed torpidly below duvet for fifteen minutes, drowsing until the second alarm sounded, whereupon they rolled sideways and begrudgingly opened their eyes to greet a striated pattern of streaked sunlight filtered through the blinds, coruscant on the coarse paint of their bedroom wall, leaving slim oblongs of silver to wriggle in the breeze, which they observed, as if somehow other than humdrum, before rising from bed and inhabitng an outfit of unwashed though neither creased nor dirty clothes: a pair of tight fitting charcoal jeans, a beige marl vest and a navy blue cardigan, to which they would later add grey socks and tattered plimsolls,",
"Under their instruction, the students – the putatively unblemished promise of tomorrow – were to parse the afternoon’s task, their trim fingers raised cogitatively to prepare abstract passages, whose composition, they anticipated, would induce thought’s manumission, the imagination there unbridled and relinquished to a deluge of spontaneity as hands scribbled such that soma and psyche would converge, enveloped in silence as bodies bristled and intellect expanded, braced for the inexorable cascade of concepts that would arrive in unforeseen clusters of colour and affect, flung beyond limit and repetition and the self-similitude of degraded life, as if prose were to glance the absolute, the momentary escape of newness or the possibility of difference; or this was the intention, they supposed, and, however grandiloquently it resounded, they maintained that the class ought to have undergone some form of liberation, if only to impart their words with a modicum of concomitant intrigue, apparent in negations of rote regularity and floundering banality;",
"Hitherto morning’s arrival, the worker, who would one day discover the power of God, had considered themself happy, or content, they had thought, in relation to their friends: their depressive and sporadically indigent crew, whom they deemed trammelled by selfpity, their maladies remediable by mere willed optimism;",
"As they hurtled across the autumnal gloom, traversing its faceless, blanket expanse, with neither freedom nor pleasure trailered in tow, the worker typed a rhythmic clicking to accompany the judder of metal on ground, constructing their correspondences whilst swathed in electric thrum, their thoughts focused and lucid, undeviating until they sensed the inexorable push of chair against back, there noticing their deceleration, felt as gradual then sudden, as they drew to a halt at a small, dusky station, at which the cessation prompted them to look from their screen to the empty carriage, apprehending its decrepitude, in frayed upholstery and graffiti smirched tables and foot-worn flooring, from which the journey’s few remaining passengers had filtered doorwards and had seeped onto the platform, orienting attention to the faintly visible concrete, whereon silhouetted figures bustled beside a reclined body metres to their left, conspicuously static as the worker’s vision turned thereto, their eyes straining to puncture the window’s gossamer reflection, spread by the yellow gleam and penetrated seconds later to reveal the image of a sleeping bag sprawled across a bench, the paint of which had flaked, and the frame of which was speckled with rust, positioned three paces from limply-hung refuse sacks, their skin rippling as the worker observed the slumbering stretch, spotting small dark movements above and beneath, flitting back and forth, scuttling until a dark, liquorice-like tail lingered for several seconds, bolting upon the sleeper’s shuffle, its bag unzipped to reveal a pink face and shoulder length hair, there stuffed within a jumper neck and unmoving as the figure sat upright, their palms flattened whilst their head rotated from side to side, resting to observe a bag of possessions, which conspicuously rustled an erratic shuffle, and with which the sleeper retained eye contact, sliding their legs free and delicately rotating hips to leave a pair of sneaker-wrapped feet suspended vigilantly above the floor, at right angles to the seat, until, rapidly, the two struck down, stamping a hard, frenetic dance, hammering, before the right foot froze, its arch taut and ball pressed to earth, angled as they slowly swivelled their arm and shoulder to grip the sack’s edges, their trainer edging away to reveal the twitching and writhing body of a rat, whose lower limbs were clasped underfoot and whose ribs had been crushed,",
"Lodged in the plastic smother of an over-stuffed leatherette, its soft swivel eliciting a synthetic crunch, the worker reclined to apprehend the screens before him, their arm extended and palm outstretched to enclose a corded mouse, with wrist twitching to flit between deskperched monitors, between the various camera feeds therein,"
]
const second = ["though, that day, at some time around noon, a seldom heard bell was struck and the shopfloor was plunged into a dark and uneasy quietude, such that the workers stopped talking or assembling or transporting components and the machinery was immobilised, leaving a heavy silence, punctured only by the occasional distant clink and the steady dripping of a rivulet of condensation, which made its way from the ceiling onto a girder, and rolled, before falling at the worker’s bench, on which a shallow grey puddle had begun to form, depressing the surface, so that it would warp and creak and disintegrate over the coming months, bending and flaking into soft, sodden chunks, whose early formation the worker felt as they placed their hand on the bench and cast their eyes around the room, to where there was little movement and where the younger employees had anxiously begun to ricochet glances off one another, visibly bewildered by this strange cessation in the working day, to which they were unaccustomed and which induced in them an excitable, almost febrile state; though the worker, who had acquired prior experience of such recesses, was comparably placid, certain the pause was on account of the procedure to shut down upon accident;",
"and thus, when the worker noticed an emboldened email slumped midway down their inbox homepage, they felt the necessity of drafting a full and immediate response, which if the received message bore only a standard question – as thankfully it did – would occupy them for no more than five minutes, leaving their free to enjoy their break unfettered by worries of work undone, though, if any esoteric request had been lodged, obliging them to defer to their line manager, to telephone Julie, or, worse, head office – from where a swift answer would not be forthcoming – the task would inevitably infringe upon lunch, pilfering precious moments of nonlabour from an otherwise tiresome day, in a regard that would never be recouped and never remunerated,",
"and so, relieved, they stepped aboard the bus and took one last glance at the fetid animal, which failed to return their gaze, its flaccid neck twisted skyward, above and away from the worker and the road and the world of mediocrity and habit, from which they too believed to be turning from as they prised open their wallet and retrieved a travel ticket, brandished level with the blank countenance of the driver, who, saying nothing, waited several seconds and waved them in, prompting the worker to march inside and shuffle their frame through a huddle of elderly bodies, after which they stepped above the rear wheels and swiftly took the first available aisle space, there noticing that the seat had been somehow blackened by a spillage or a burn or by vandalism, which while less than desirable was scant deterrent to the worker, who was eager to be off their feet and did not especially mind enduring a less than pristine chair for fifteen minutes;",

"so that, with time to fritter, they perused a scuffed and faded catalogue unearthed from beneath their table, reading for some five minutes until they found themselves overwhelmed by the sheer volume of objects strewn across its pages, objects that to their seemed endless and whose origin was unexplained and whose functions were essentially uniform: there were countless pages of tables and chairs, of appliances and crockery, all of which were fundamentally interchangeable but none of which the worker recognised from their home, such that, by the absence of their family’s possessions, they concluded that there must be further, additional catalogues elsewhere too, filled with untold numbers of other commensurate products, whose dimensions and colours and materials differed slightly but which were amassed to fulfil kindred domestic roles; and hence, surveying this ostensibly infinite market, the worker for the first time felt the wealth of society present itself to their as an immense accumulation of commodities, its unit being a single commodity, available for trade and exchange, such that, should they accrue the requisite funds, they could acquire objects of immeasurable variety, prompting them to imagine the purchases they might make when older, when furnishing their own home, thinking of the possessions they would prefer given different levels of income: the most tasteful decorations for their rich, poor and middle-income self, in the manifold lifestyles they would lead surrounded with such things;",
"so the worker moved their head cupwards to imbibe, eager to retain the promise of the integral work, unadmixed with traces of home or self, taking several overly hot mouthfuls before raising pen – an emerald green biro – and proceeding to annotate, determined to complete their workload before sundown yet careful to write unobtrusively within margins, in a hue so chosen as to avoid the pitfalls of combative red or authoritative black, in a common sense decision adopted by teachers everywhere, but which, whilst marking, they came to question, supposing there was little reason to believe others received the ink as imagined, for its affective resonance surely depended on the viewer and their interpretative faculties, they thought, which if sufficiently dissimilar to have construed the pitiful assignments as interesting – in a verdict the worker strongly diverged from – were equally liable to consider the significance of colour differently too, so, conceivably, it made no difference which pen they used, yet tradition had made its decision and further introspection would only delay, they conjectured,",
"such that they swiftly closed their phone and continued walking, channelling thoughts to their afternoon’s chores: their tasks to beautify the flat and to earmark improvements, which engendered little enthusiasm but which they resolved to undertake nevertheless, wending flatwards whilst ten minutes therefrom, their passage sheathed by anonymous residential developments, as steel panelled mediocrity loomed, in large-scale tract housing developments that constituted the new city; they were located everywhere, they thought, they were not particularly bound to existing communities and they failed to develop either regional characteristics or separate identity,",
"meaning that workers were to draw from their own consumptive experience and remembrance, acquired in excess of employment; for what distinguished capitalism from the master-servant relation, the worker supposed, was that worker confronted boss as consumer and possessor of exchange values, and that in the form of the possessor of money, they became a centre of circulation, one of its infinitely many centres, in which their specificity as a worker was extinguished, such that they and the junior staff and the investors achieved an equality of experience and dignity in the marketplace, where prospective purchasing eroded the accumulated differences of history and of experience, which – without hesitation – returned in the office, where hierarchy reigned, irrespective of policy or proclamation or the parity of exchange,",
"such that they fell overcome with guilt at their inaction in the present, at their reliance on the illusory consistency of machine, there convinced that they ought to have known better than to luxuriate in the false comfort of the archive, for the true picture of the past whizzed by, they thought, and only as a picture, which flashes its final farewell in the moment of its recognisability, is the past to be held fast, meaning that only a constant vigilance would retain a grip on the chaotic flux of history, such qualities there summoned as the worker sought to regain their professionalism – evoked to atone for their blundering oversight – as they looked to penetrate the semblant regularity of footage and to demonstrate their worth, their sense of corporate validation felt absent yet wanted whilst they gazed upon the canteen’s placidity, and upon an almost empty exterior wall, innocuously speckled with the first soft spots of snowfall as they looked to the shopfloor, in scrutiny of which, they resolved, they would settle for nothing less than the concrete analysis of concrete situations leading to concrete actions; silence is assent, they thought, and they sought to find malpractice, through identification of tardiness or poor technique, much as they found none, there observing only the rhythmic grind of productivity, implacably driven forward and relentless in its parsimony, as if engineered to emphasise the worker’s ineptitude, with their incompetence exaggerated by the standard displayed, for once efficiency is universally accepted as a rule, as it had been, they supposed, it becomes an inner compulsion and weighs like a sense of sin, simply because no one can ever be efficient enough, just as no one can ever be virtuous enough when confronted by such proficiency, the factory’s every facet there harmonised to maximise output, with contours moulded to appear natural, as if merely given in the ideal genesis of society;",

"and, they supposed, if someone else were to engage in handling their looks, were they to focus exclusively on her, diligently and meticulously, it might enable them to construe self-care as somehow better founded and more justified than an act of mere personal preference; though they remained unsure of this urge to affirmation and suspected it might only bolster their resented tendency to selfdiscipline, and, moreover, they knew, it was only elicited by commerce and would feel hollow,",
"and so, should they have wanted to, they could have had themselves believe that they floated ten feet above the ground, and had nothing to do with the historical situation out of which they had grown: they could have presumed themselves to be an entity all to itself, and they would have liked to have done so, yet, their mind was at that point plagued by images of their former wife, the other worker, who had entered their thoughts and there rested as an intransigent reminder of how they were not self-contained but was emphatically mired in the world, lost and sad and angry at they who had left and immiserated him, and against whom they desired some form of redress, wanting to voice their anger at their predicament – which they had never done – and to tell them how completely selfish and cowardly and filthy they were, which the worker suspected would devastate, because, like most, the other worker could not abide the idea that they were deemed truly wretched, which at times they thought, though, more frequently, the worker did not; rather, they longed for them to telephone and reveal that the past two years had been awful mistakes, that they loved him, and that they ought to rewind to whence they were both happier, yet they suspected such conversation would not occur;",
"though, much as they there recognised the displayed products, they thought, they were ultimately items of which they had little if any direct knowledge, and so they had no little sense of the sort of world they might beget, leaving them to feel that what really lay before their was not a multitude of commodities, useable and tangible, but only a conglomeration of images: they were looking at paper, laden with ink, replete with full colour photographs captured from lustrously lit studios, where filters had been applied and shots manipulated too, by someone, somewhere, such that the pictures were orchestrated to convince their of a world that was better and bolder than felt, beyond or before their lived experience, so that the worker there wondered whether it had always been that images arrived prior to an object’s use or whether there had been a point at which life had changed − perhaps with the introduction of catalogues or photography − for it seemed to their that the whole life of those societies in which modern conditions of production prevailed presented itself as an immense accumulation of spectacles, meaning that all that was once directly lived had been diverted into representation; and these spectacles, they conjectured, were not just pictures: they were sets of social relations among people, mediated by images: the appearance of the catalogue items had been conceived to elicit affect, engendering fear and desire in their viewers, and they established a link between observer and imagemaker, between buyer and seller, and between the powerless and powerful too, and it was within this web of relations that the worker dwelled before the school bell chimed, its chime there declaring that a new period had begun and that it was time to move;",
"so they silenced their procrastinatory doubts and continued to grade and comment, as neatly as possible, selfconsciously considering the severity of remarks as they refrained from sincere judgment, inserting only grammatical corrections and jovial encouragements, in annotated banalities and exclamations, for they knew that if honestly articulated – with neither diplomacy nor personal consideration – the objections would sound more intolerant than they were; there are qualifications, they thought, yet little space to elaborate thereupon, to defend the importance of newness, or of rupture from barbarism, or to argue modernity’s virtue,",
"such that their desired self-estrangement – their release from anhedonic narcissism – would not spur from their environment, from a landscape that evoked little but domestic monotony and life’s banal perpetuation, in frigid new-builds sat pregnant with disappointment, but required mentality to migrate, prompting the worker to blinker their vision, wrapping the journey with detachment, thankful they lived elsewhere as they gazed at their phone, there staring maniacally to shift between updates, from friends and family, which proclaimied triumph and pride and satisfaction, through videos and photographs and snippets of writing, curated to highlight the inadequacy of their pitifully unloved condition yet sufficient to retain their attention, exasperating in images of promotions and anniversaries and exotic travel, joyful reunions and housewarmings eddying forth as they arrived at the apartment building, whereupon they paused, returning their phone to pocket to substitute its rubber-clad bulk for the metallic looseness of keys, swirled in hand, before they opened the post-box and unveiled a medley of gloss flyers and sealed envelopes, imprinted with tenants’ names and destined for disposal, but gripped, tightly, as they entered the vestibule, where they looked for residents but found none, there discovering only an unfamiliar lilac paint that had been applied in recent days, which was drying pungently, as if to exaggerate the service company’s involvement – deemed feeworthy in its decoration, with paint as good as it was in the can – but which they overlooked as they slipped toward the elevator and called for the fifth floor, ascending whilst faced with the mirror’s listless figure, which stood somehow limper and fleshier and older than yesterday, its clothes strangely ill-fitting and make-up less consummately applied, smeared and deformed by tears, as they saw themself as an ungainly whole, as if for the first time, helpless to a degeneration that further depressed,",
"so that, much as the worker recognised each managed subject as thoughtful and independent, they simultaneously retained an acute awareness of their domination, and of their relative empowerment, manifest in the capacity to instruct and to reprimand, to raise pay and to hire, and to direct others, whose exact competencies and potentials they neither knew nor would discover, such that they had grown increasingly unsure as to the purpose and longevity of workplace subordination, uncertain as to why – without rigorous inquiry – workers would persist in their subservience, for there was no self-evident justification for their supremacy, or for their subjugation: they possessed neither palpable skill nor attribute nor epistemic advantage to vindicate the inequity, no ability that one could point to or illustrate; rather, their only proficiency was a diffuse, interactional habitus, hidden and obscure, yet somehow sufficient to uphold authority, there manifest in the subtle sculpture of managerial manoeuvre, in the plastic flex of their corporate intervention, whereby strategic acuity yielded the precise, puppet-like orchestration of others, with synchronisation induced through incentives and discourse, in kindly praise and authoritative sanction, which, once delicately deployed, bestowed enterprise its accordance with desire, rendered comprehensible in profit and in the satisfaction of anonymous hordes, known only as aggregative data, in accounts and in graphs and in the website analytics that filtered back to chime, tuning-fork-like and sonorous, as directions for action, operating to leave the worker indifferent to the commodities vended: objects of every sort were materials for their art, they supposed: paint, chairs, food, electric and neon lights, smoke, water, old socks, a dog, movies, a thousand other things which were yet to be discovered by the present generation of entrepreneurs; not only will bold managers show others, as if for the first time, the world they have had around them, but ignored, they thought, but they will disclose entirely unheard of happenings and events, found in garbage cans, police files, hotel lobbies, seen in store windows and on the streets, and sensed in dreams, as the architecture of administration spread to even the most exotic, most distant recesses of life, charting ever further terrain for settlement, bestowing the worker with a degree of certitude for their position’s persistence, comforting their as they continued to type, there working with a pronounced sense of productivity until they felt their stomach cramp, the silent scrunch of which prompted them to head unhesitatingly for the train’s bathroom,",
"though, of course, the worker knew better, having overseen its refinement themself, in meetings and discussion and in endless detailed analyses of productivity and profitability, of security and labour, because the enterprise continually faced the necessity of restructuring the production process, not only to reduce unit costs and to elude recessions, they thought, but even more compellingly to retain their hold over the class struggle, where continued victory demanded production’s advance, bolstering its logic such that the worker was glad to belong to the managerial strata, and not only for the triumph, gleaned in enduring success, nor merely for the comforts this compact afforded; rather, the quality of the labour itself pleased, for the worker had always disliked direct contact with fabrication, their disposition ever-averse to physicality – in the sullying contact of skin and product – because, they supposed, the world was full of objects, more or less interesting; they did not wish to add any more; they preferred, simply, to state the existence of things in terms of time and place, logging and documenting the toil of others whilst sheltered by the steady substance of data, whose comforts they considered, observing camera feeds and scanning the glimmering spread for several minutes, dutifully, before they resolved to enjoy a short break, secure in the knowledge that little of note would unfold, and that adjournment would restore professional capacities,",

const eighth = ["and the worker thought of this as the call sounded to return to work, upon which they immediately resumed assembling the furniture before him, putting together bits and pieces around them to form the semblance of a whole, which today was a coffee table that required the slotting in and screwing together of three separate component parts, there undertaken repeatedly, professionally and competently, because, as tedious as the work was, it was preferable to any of the machine jobs, in which the chances of injury were high and in which the worker felt they were 8 likely to befall some period of worklessness; so they ploughed through monotony of their appointed task, handling and fastening with steady technique, item after item, as they laboured sufficiently well to avoid earmarking for restationing; though they gradually realised that however adept they became at assembly – however consummate their hand grew – any fabrication would inevitably deny the identifiable trace of their touch or competencies; indeed, the better they got at their job, the less evident their labour would be: the finished object would appear as spontaneous, as though no human hand had graced it before, so that it struck them that they were in some regards – unit by unit – eradicating their personality, constructing empty, soulless products, entirely alienable from their personhood, rendering them replaceable by another proficient employee or a machine, such that the emptiness of the pieces of furniture they made, which were by and large straight lines and plain surfaces, in plastics and veneers, chipboards and bracing, were conspicuous in their minimal personal content: in that either they were to an extreme degree undifferentiated in themselves and therefore possessed very low content of any kind, or else the differentiation that they did exhibit, which was in some cases very considerable, came not from the worker but from a non-personal source like a management request or a demand-responsive algorithm,",
"and so, as their eyes roamed athwart the high street, the worker felt themselves encircled by a panoply of prospects to intensify self-relations through money: to improve their home’s interior, to enhance their body with health foods, to exercise at a gym, to attire themselves in newer, brighter clothing, and to procure a mortgage, with the litany of products unfolding further, such that they were provoked to consider just how the world had been structured to accommodate its overwhelming preoccupation with the individual on every petty level, to the extent that it seemed absurd to brook its demands, though the worker knew their personal investment – their tacit approval of its regimen – was more than mere choice, for were they to cease to manicure themselves or to decorate their house, to refuse to regulate their image of competency, they would suffer, socially and financially, as friends and job prospects dissolved, such that they concluded that the margin for alterity – where one might differ from the norm – was minutely fine, leaving life lived otherwise to appear a practical impossibility,",
"though before they were able to retrogress to mere tears and rage, they noticed they were nearly home and so took the final left turn to the bottom of the block and there retrieved keys to unlock the door, silently stepping inside the magnolia vestibule, wherein there was always the danger of encountering their neighbours – with whom they did not want to converse, but to whom they did not want to appear rude either – so that, hastily, they pressed the elevator button to wait for its arrival, which thankfully did not take long, permitting them to enter swiftly and ascend to the fifth floor, there staring at the full length image of themselves reflected in the mirrored wall, assessing their appearance and judging themselves to be fractionally more fatigued-looking than usual, though not markedly different, which prompted the worker to consider the ways in which they had gradually changed, physically and mentally, in the years since inhabitating the building, since twice-daily confronting a full length mirror, concluding that, on account of the reflection, they had set about correcting their posture and had groomed their hair more meticulously than before and – because of their new familiarity with their integral appearance – they had also begun to regard themselves differently: as one more aware of their physical form and coordination than others, and at a higher order, as one able to consider the transformation taken place in the subject once they assume an image, with this latter thought throwing the worker into a further spiral of meditation, in which they contemplated the myriad ways that intimacy with their image had fed back into the way they handled themselves – how they looked – and, then, how the alterations consequently made to their appearance had affected the way in which they thought of their self-constitution, and, then, how that knowledge of themselves had also affected their appearance, and, then, how that had affected their self-regard, and, then, how that had affected their appearance and how that had affected their self-regard, and it was like a hall of mirrors – bottomless yet sealed – and unclear as to how difference might intrude, so that the worker thought it exhausting to consider and was relieved to hear the bell chime for their floor, whereupon they turned from their image and trudged through the corridor to their apartment, opening the door and entering, halting, momentarily, before they allowed a wave of blood to surge to their face, overwhelming as they let out a burst of warm, exasperated breaths and sobs, clenching their chest as they thought of the other worker, who was gone and who had been replaced by a biting sense of helplessness, which the worker invariably felt and expressed each day upon arriving home, crying with both pain and pleasure, such that this spluttering condition now defined free time;",
"and so, cogitative and concerned, they rose to amble towards their scheduled lesson, deciding that although the classroom lay on the other side of the campus they would wend slowly, hoping to avoid excessive interactions with classmates, whom they thought of without fondness whilst wandering through fluorescent-lit corridors, there shining and redolent of industry, until they came to an outside area, over which they strolled before reaching another building to locate the room in which they were due, which was stuffed with chattering voices and liveliness and had desks arranged in a horseshoe formation, as was standard throughout the college, for it seemed that staff had at some point agreed that such a design was most conducive to student attainment − which was here paramount − and had accordingly positioned the tables in a U-shape around the centre of the space, in a formation that was generally regarded as a marvellous machine which, whatever use one may wish to put it to, produced homogeneous effects of power, allowing for easy discipline and communication, and meaning that if one was tardy, as today the worker was, all would see,",
"so that, muting their grievances, they begrudgingly ploughed through further alienating similarity, finishing their first mugful of coffee once three assignments had been marked, whereupon downing the drink they took sight of a double-sided bundle that threatened reprieve from boredom, in a strange and unfinished piece, whose perusal revealed a plotless carnivalesque scenario that rotated a cast of characters, turntable-like, around a central male voyeur, in a piece unbridled by psychology or narrative and in which figures engaged in what the narrator could only describe as total pandemonium: the people around them were shouting, laughing and gesticulating; and the replies were sighs of love, volleys of hiccups, poems, moos, and the meowing of medieval Brutists; one man in front of them was wiggling their behind like the belly of an Oriental dancer, another was playing an invisible violin and bowing and scraping, a woman, with a Madonna face, was doing the splits, and a character was banging away nonstop on a great drum, with a man accompanying them on the piano, pale as a chalky ghost, hammering until the scene terminated without conclusion, the text left to drift mid-sentence, as if to claim distinctiveness through incompletion, there registered, its hallucinatory panorama reverberant as the worker poured a second coffee and smiled, pleasantly surprised at the deviation from school standard though unsure of their assessment: structurally the writing was unique, they thought, yet it lacked the luculence required of the curriculum, with each of its two swollen paragraphs littered with flagrant misspellings and wayward punctuation, its clumsily constructed sentences left to rove overly long, indifferent to their solecistic missteps, such that it engendered a grading dilemma: whether to award marks for novelty or to reprimand for clumsiness, in a difficulty pondered whilst slurping the lukewarm brew, there rising to prepare an evening meal, an oven-cook moussaka, purchased whilst commuting, which they clutched before discarding its card sleeve and film lid, unsheathing the metal-cradled hulk to load the oven, hovering nearby as they distractedly dwelt on the story and its author, Simon, a meek and conspicuously ungroomed teenager, who for all their artlessness had conjured wild and unpredictable images, ostensibly too extreme for their uncultivated way with grammar, in words sufficiently odd as to prompt the worker to consider fantasy and the unhabitual, and from whence they came in such a student: whether from memory or from some other subterranean force whose shadowy recesses brought forth alterity and whose nature the worker wished to probe further but did not, deciding, instead, to continue marking, there quietening their thoughts as they sensed the creeping approach of twilight, conscious that little more than half an hour’s labour awaited if undertaken with concentration and parsimony,",

"the qualities of publicness or privateness are imposed on things, the worker thought, and so they gestated a fraught emotional state throughout the day, maintaining a stolid disposition at work and releasing their desperation all the more intensely in private evenings, doing so with such regularity that they now thought of the flat as a lachrymal, miserable space, and had found themselves oddly thankful for work, for the job’s otherness and analgesia: for the fact that at work the sorrow and loss of their failed relationship was made to temporarily dissipate, the unceasing pressure of their managers’ requests such that for at least eight hours a day they were compelled to forget their loneliness, their body forced to labour swiftly and efficiently, oblivious to the sadness elicited by thoughts of the other worker, so that they overlooked their current sense of directionlessness, evading all thought of the bleakness of their future, without the eruption of paroxysmal fear and weeping, such that the job had assumed a new kind of comfort, permitting them to tender melancholy for a form of compulsive automatism, preferable to the crippling depression of home; although, it had previously been the warehouse routine that they had loathed above 56 all else, hating it to the extent that they had only confirmed they loved the other worker whilst undertaking the job, devoting themselves to them in the face of their devastating alienation, because romance, they thought, had offered reprieve from the exhausting boredom of daily rountine, in which they retrieved commodities from shelves for people they would never know and who would never know him; and in this sense the relation between labour and romance had vacillated, they despised the warehouse then needed it then abhorred it again; he moved from repulsion to gratitude, from attention to distraction, and returned: it spiralled, such that there was nothing there to exhaust, it was endless the way a road might be, so that work followed them after hours, journeying home and carried by its absence, to leave labour present, immanent as they walked through the hallway to their bathroom and sat and defecated, anticipating then enjoying the subsequent din of their micturition, which prompted them to recline for ten minutes afterwards, narcotised in a state of satisfying emptiness, their thoughts winding through fragments of pop songs and television programmes, baking and holidays, until gradually they refocused on work, which the worker – whose legs ached and whose ankles throbbed – did not wish to attend but which they thought could be worse,",
"and thus the worker, whose seat lay on the other side of the classroom, felt compelled to scurry across in full view of their fellow students, in front of the whiteboard and over a ridged, brown carpet, festooned with polkadots of blackened gum, to arrive at a desk whose surface was adorned with a small calligraphic graffito biroed onto the polished MDF, and whose veneer had begun to peel, and at which, after sitting, they retrieved their pen and sketchbook for the lesson, though upon seeing that none of their peers had done likewise they pushed them aside and faced forward to observe their form tutor, a young man with a trimmed auburn beard, who stood in conversation with a police officer, whom the worker reasoned would be introduced to the group to discuss drugs or the ideal of community or the prospects of a life in the force or some other nonsense that they did not want to hear, distrusting the police from their prior experience,",
"meaning the worker ignored their ruminations and resumed station, where they stowed aside Simon’s passage and deferred grading until morning, delving once more into the melange of middling English assignments, briskly running their eyes over a duo of sunset and sunrise parables that portrayed protagonists gazing upon bucolic and urban half-lights as they considered childhood and ageing and a host of other fluffily-posed existential questions, which they patronised with ticks on correct semi-colons and adjectival clauses, dotting the sheets green until, once adequately bejewelled with written approval, they cautiously awarded “B plus” grades and disregarded the pieces, there seeing they had only four passages left,",
"so that they strove to differentiate themself from their landlordism, from which they felt distinct, as somehow less acquisitive and less grasping and more vulnerable than was suggested, with circumstances unique, in that they had not sought to subsidise their income but merely to subsist stably, sheltered from the vagaries of finance in a mental and material cocoon that incubated the thoughtfulness and creativity extinguished in work, which they had tried to preserve, declining all conventional employment, with neither the talent or disposition for a career, and with a hatred for forays into the labour market, from which they unfailingly recoiled, with a biting, visceral pain, suffered as if wounded, or the worker saw nothing in waged work but the governance and domination they had sought to resist, for to be governed, they felt, was to be watched, inspected, spied upon, directed, law-driven, numbered, regulated, enrolled, indoctrinated, preached at, controlled, checked, estimated, valued, censured, commanded, by creatures who had neither the right nor the wisdom nor the virtue to do so, so, yes, they affirmed, to be governed was to be at every operation, at every transaction noted, registered, counted, taxed, stamped, measured, numbered, assessed, licensed, authorized, admonished, prevented, forbidden, reformed, corrected, punished: it was, under pretext of public utility, and in the name of the general interest, to be placed under contribution, drilled, fleeced, exploited, monopolized, extorted from, squeezed, hoaxed, robbed; then, at the slightest resistance, the first word of complaint, to be repressed, fined, vilified, harassed, hunted down, abused, clubbed, disarmed, bound, choked, imprisoned, judged, condemned, shot, deported, sacrificed, sold, betrayed; and to crown it all, mocked, ridiculed, derided, outraged, dishonoured, that was government; that was its justice; that was its morality, and the worker strove to contest its oversight in every form, determined to retain a modicum of autonomy, even if unsure how to use it, their direction there uncertain in the absence of the driving affirmative desires that might fill nonparticipation’s emptiness: they could do this today and that tomorrow, they thought, to hunt in the morning, to go fishing in the afternoon, to do cattle breeding in the evening, to criticise after dinner, or to pursue whatever other absurdity they contrived,",
"such that they tutted to an imagined audience and bolted the door, there unspooling a scrunched handful of paper – sufficiently voluminous to bar permeative contact – that they gripped and wiped back and forth, as if polishing, buffing its plastic until, once sufficiently residue-free, they slackened and dropped their trousers, stooping as they felt the slow and loosening satisfaction of defecation flow from spine outwards, sinking a relieving heft as they fell overcome with a pleasant emptiness, calmed and comfortable as they sat, aware of their enjoyment, feeling – in mystic-like fashion – that evacuation’s release denied the ego and the individual personality, evoking, it seemed, a semihypnotic state of blank unconsciousness, so that they could recline in a thoughtless, meditative state, absent-mindedly turning to their phone’s social media feed, which had grown passively consumed in recent months, enlisted merely for news, of personal and political intrigue, and for entertainment,",
"though, they reasoned, the qualities of publicness or privateness are imposed on things: there is no innate realm of self-ownership, and certainly no proprietary image, which was ultimately all one was before administration, for the whole life of those societies in which modern conditions of production prevailed presented itself as an immense accumulation of spectacles, they thought, the reality of which was not merely a collection of images, but a social relation among people, mediated by images, so that in their interactions, in interventionary oversight, the worker saw mere images yet manipulated real, human activity, in the clear choreography of footage transmitted, whose rhythms and values they constructed, with focus fixed to its flicker, cemented, as if all of value would appear on screen, as if all that had once been directly lived was now diverted into representation, and as if the old laws of the earthly order would no longer apply, their strictures dismantled for the efflorescence of a hollow cinematograph world, into which the worker probed ever further, their eyes fervently navigating the building’s walkways, in empty vestibules and endless staircases, with click and key to orient their passage,",

"so that there, whilst transfixed on its spectacle, the worker was struck by the thought that objects of every sort are materials for the new window display: paint, chairs, food, electric and neon lights, old socks, a dog, movies, a thousands other things, that had been discovered by the present generation of visual merchandisers; not only did these designers show people, as if for the first time, the world they have always had about them but ignored, but they disclosed entirely unheard-of happenings and events, found in garbage cans, police files, hotel lobbies; seen in other store windows and on the streets; and sensed in dreams and horrible accidents: they offered countless visual delights and curious forms, happy to distract from the miserable turn of the world, reliably offering a semblance of originality – ever new and always the same – as they luxuriated, like swine, in the ever-enticing muck of profit, their logic disclosed only to patient study,",
"and, they supposed, previous jobs had been worse: at least the warehouse did not oblige them to engage their emotions or to lie, as was previously asked, and, when they reflected further, their job, working in such a vast building for a truly global organisation, had much to commend it: the work had the feel and look of openness, extendibility, accessibility, publicness, repeatability, equanimity, directness, immediacy, and it had been formed by clear decision rather than groping craft and this was appreciable, they thought, as they moved into the living room and collapsed on the couch, where they surveyed the sparsely furnished apartment, which had been rendered minimal because the other worker had owned and taken most of the characterful things in the flat, and because they had not sought replacements: the other worker had taken a large, inherited grandfather clock, several framed paintings and a vast array of decorative knick-knacks and souvenirs: in short, they had reclaimed everything that could be posited on a continuum between the monument and the ornament, and thus there was little to distinguish this flat from any of the building’s others; the remaining furniture, which the worker now sat amongst, had been included in the rental of the apartment and displayed a sort of impersonal and generic wipe-down shininess chosen by the landlord: a collocation of laminated, mirrored and plastic objects that all signified some sense of modernity, but which, the worker assumed, were designed to be as inoffensive and as market-friendly and empty as possible, exhibiting an apparent soullessness, which, at this juncture in their life, they found strangely comforting, feeling that their form offered a modicum of solace from their relationship strife, for, when placed in the context of their life with the other worker – in a world that had been structured around years of intimacy, of daily conversation and emotional involvement – which had then painfully collapsed, the furniture, in all its anonymity, felt closer to being their than any of the more meaningful objects that previously surrounded him: that is, the landlord’s furniture, permanently divested of personality, was not of the other worker, and so unlike the other decorations and objects they co-owned – which obeyed a deeply planted traditionalism with respect to their meaning – were things that were not constructed around any notion of personal intention that might point directly inward: to the privacy of their or their mental space, instead, the flat’s furniture made meaning a function of surface, of the external, the public, or a space that was in no way a signifier of the a priori, or of the privacy of intention: in this flat, what you saw was what you saw and that was not the ghost of the other worker,",
"such that they scrutinised the officer in front of them, who stood confidently and proudly, in heavy blue trousers and a meticulously pressed white shirt with short sleeves and dark epaulettes, distinguished from their torso and from the sickly pallor of their face, which was topped with a hoary blanket of greased hair;",
"so that, swiftly, they reached for another stapled bundle, which was unnamed and untitled, and while this was irritating for administration and for teacherly contextualisation it was relatively inconsequential, because identification would unfold in tomorrow’s class regardless,",
"yet somehow they felt dissatisfied by mere concatenated pleasures, felt hollow in their aggregate, for the worker yearned to exceed their rhapsodic fun, through an achievement or narrative, which, they thought, might bestow an otherwise vacuously episodic existence with rich, continuous significance, such as would render meaningful the vapid socialising and incomplete betterment of recent years, legitimating their pointless learning and nocturnal hedonisms with the deliverance of a family, or a child, there furnishing life with semblant purpose, which they desired and which they thought of with increased regularity, picturing the warm maternity ward in which small, soft fingers were to be placed in hers, in their infant’s first moments, wherefrom afterwards they would depart to a modest detached home, far from the city, in which they and their imagined partner would hold to each other and to their newborn, bathed in nourishing togetherness and thrust impossibly close, as if inextricable, glued by commitment as they endeavoured to sustain one another, loved in relative prosperity, with birthdays and celebrations and holidays and laughter amassing in integral form, as an unbreakable whole, to be reviewed with contentment upon death’s arrival, their lives ended with a sense of completion, with the assurance that something of substance had been done; yet it had not, and, gradually, it dawned upon the worker that it would not, their childless future there projected insistently in the face of all contrary ambitions, which they had attempted to actualise – on myriad, strained occasions – when they had devoted themself to partners, and to the image of domestic development, eager for consequential life to commence, in their resolute investment in romance and its persistence and progression, committed thereto despite their lovers’ demerits, despite their arrogance and their smug superiority and their insistent desire for rightness, which, whilst once enjoyable – in its smooth screen of security – soon grew repulsive, its image inexorably expressive of the accreted condescensions of the world, as if symbolic of their ongoing struggle for independence, and of their failures therewith;",
"such that the worker scrolled through cascades of anonymous non-sequitirs, in fragmentary statements, from corporate and individual voices alike, blurting incessantly in concerted competition to contort discourse to the standard of the homogeneous slogan-like utterance, which they ingested torpidly, thoughtlessly gorging on banal chatter until, roused by the rustle of handle and lock, they rose to clean and clothe themself, wiping then washing and briefly looking mirror-wards – to ensure the propriety of their appearance – before exiting, cheerily bypassing an elderly woman to meander to their table, where they arrived to find its space personless, with neighbour ostensibly elsewhere, and only an empty can and open laptop to indicate the impermanence of absence,",
"until, soon, they had perambulated half of the factory’s floor, in a frictionless sweep, smoothly veering past machine and office, through order and efficiency, tracing the building’s southern-most corridors, until they stopped, paused, before what appeared to be a lone, workless worker stood dumbly static, whom they assumed to be maintenance staff, there garbed in dark, multi-pocketed trousers, and with bucket in hand, their countenance turned from camera, with slight movements 83 manifest in occasional nods, delivered gingerly, as if consulting some superior beyond screen, to whom they gestured for approval, with each periodic, furtive communication followed by a prolonged groundward stare, establishing a bizarre back and forth ritual, repeated five times, insistently, before the worker eventually raised their head and shuffled to the centre of the frame, where, slowly and purposefully, they placed the bucket below their legs, positioned decisively as they shimmied forward to unbuckle their belt, unlooping its leather tongue before unzipping their fly, there pinching the elastic of their underwear and tugging rapidly to expose a conspicuously pale and hairless lower body, swiftly covered as they squatted atop the bucket, with jacket hem lowered to knee height, at which it remained for what clock and camera recorded as thirty seconds but which the worker experienced as impossibly elongated, the duration deepened as they gazed disbelievingly at the sight of quasi-public defecation, the worker ostensibly untroubled by any sense of shame or fear, excreting worrilessly as fluids fell egested, squitted in a passageway that could, at any moment, undergo the footfall of fire alarm or delivery,",

"so that, the worker decided, they would scrutinise the next window they passed in such a regard that those choices withdrawn and opaque to most would egress from beneath its gaudy veneer, meaning that, as they drew close to a second clothes outlet, they slowed to absorb its entire design, which had placed porcelain white mannequins atop mirrored plinths, each one outfitted in different muted ashen and chalky tones, spotted with the occasional burgundy or olive wool and perched in front of a large minimal design, whose outline was that of a black rectangle, sufficiently sized so as to frame the commodities, so chosen because a rectangle was a shape itself; it was obviously the whole shape; it determined and limited the arrangement of whatever was on or inside of it, and with the window rectilinear too, the clothes and plinths and mannequins appeared as though doubly framed: first by the commercial architecture then by the printed form, which was perhaps attractive to some, though the worker wished not to indulge its pulchritude but to overcome it: it was said that analysing pleasure, or beauty, destroys it, and that was their intention, for the worker loathed the fashion industry and the encumbrance it thrust upon her, which arrived not as a command but as a putative gift, sprung from transcendence to promise transcendence, meaning that clothes and shops and adverts spoke of personal freedom – of autonomy and escape – though fashion asked more than they could give: to care for and to regulate their appearance, to spend, continuously, on obsolescent distractions and to change at the behest of design;",
"and, on a practical level, this was necessary for the worker to live, for them to come home and to wash their clothes and to cook their mediocre dinner of tinned foods and toast, which they would consume later, and in preparation for which they ambled to the kitchen, there opening a cupboard and retrieving two slices of white bread and a tin of pre-cooked pasta shapes, which they resolved to eat in a hour or so, but, first, they decided, they would drink a coffee, so they grasped a jar of Nescafe and boiled the kettle to make a drink;",
"and so, as the officer was introduced and addressed the room, in the dull tones of institutional exordium, the worker reached for their pen and paper and began doodling, scribbling with such concentration that they remained oblivious to any noise emitted, for they refused to imbibe a word that this pudgy, uniformed oaf disgorged, knowing it would only contain lies and deceit, so that they resolved merely to draw, constructing an intricate, inky pattern of abstract shapes on their notepad whilst the rest of the room listened intently, and though they could barely hear the man, they could, nevertheless, discern that they were elaborating theses on the public suspicion of the police and on the unacknowledged virtues of the force, in response to which they almost guffawed, there tempted to stand and repudiate, point by point, the lies expounded, though they did not, because, they thought, it would only be dismissed as querulous or callow, as the rant of one unfamiliar with the workings of the world, from a young woman who cavilled only for the sake of chaos, such that they remained silent in the hope they would be picked on to answer a question, on the police or as to why they were so loathed, to which they would gladly respond, enumerating the countless, profound reasons, in more reasons than could be pulled from memory,",
"and, hence, unperturbed by anonymity, the worker inspected the handsomely penned text with relative indifference, allowing the passage to unravel as they found themself captivated, ensorcelled by the alarming course plotted therein, which, though begun inconspicuously, rapidly turned odd, departing from a petitbourgeois familial home decorated with polished glass and steel cleanliness, white and mirrored furniture marooned throughout its parquet expanse, such that eloquently described cubes and cuboids afforded seats and podiums for two siblings, who, home alone, danced to the radio, happily and without stress, in jovial banality until the story introduced a disturbance, its two siblings witness to a thudding at the door, to which they approached and saw that the frame to be cracked, creaking under an incessant thundering that pounded until the hinges buckled and broke and the splintered mass tumbled groundwards, three tall men phlegmatically stamping thereon to intrude, striding forward without discernible interest in the flat’s modernity and music, too focused to notice as they marched to the siblings and clutched and throttled them, to prevent their escape, their hands pressed into throats as wriggling bodies struck the wall, slammed sufficiently hard as to dissuade resistance;",

"and, while the coffee cooled and its froth bubbled, its foam sliding on a velvety blackness, they thumbed pages of a free magazine, shifting their vision between a woman in a full-page photograph and the spiralling liquid in their cup, pondering, as they did, just where the truth of such images actually resided: whether it was in their fullface shots, or in profile, but first, they thought, it was worth considering what such an object was: perhaps, they thought, it was a link that enabled people to pass from one subject to another and therefore live together, but, then, since social relations were always ambiguous, since their thought divided as much as it united, and since their words united or isolated by what they expressed or omitted, since an immense gulf separated their subjective awareness of themselves from the objective truth they represented for others, since they constantly wound up guilty, though they felt innocent, since every event transformed their daily life, since they constantly failed to communicate, to understand, to love and be loved, and every failure deepened their solitude, since they could not escape the objectivity crushing them or subjectivity expelling him, since they could not rise to a state of being, or collapse into nothingness, they must, they thought, must look around more than ever; the world, their fellow creature, their brother, the world alone, when revolutions were impossible and war loomed, when capitalism was unsure of its rights and the working class was in retreat, when the lightning progress of science made future centuries hauntingly present, when the future was more present than the present, when the distant galaxies were at their door, there, at this moment, the relentless content of the world overwhelmed, exhausting the worker as its expanse stretched beyond comprehension, swollen at the end of work, when the worker was weary and their head was heavy and when a dull throbbing rolled around their eyes,",
"so that they would say that it was because of racial profiling and because of murders in custody, it was because of rapes and assaults that had been disbelieved and because vulnerable women had been humiliated, forced to relive their own brutalization through brutality; it was because the police revelled in unwarranted aggression, and it was because they were torturous and violent, which was wrong itself but was worsened by their punishment of those whose whiteness remained in doubt; and it was because they were torturous and violent, which was wrong itself but was worsened by their punishment of those whose whiteness remained in doubt; it was because they were corrupt, it was because of the certainty of favouritism whenever called to account; it was because of Stephen Lawrence and because of Blair Peach and because of Ricky Reel and because of the masses of bodies that had been blamed for their own deaths to save careerist men, who devised fictions as real bodies screamed and bled and died; and it was because migrants and refugees had been detained and threatened in front of their families, and because starving men were imprisoned for taking from the greedy and it was because protests by decent people for decent demands had been undermined; it was because of Jean Charles de Menezes and because of Rocky Bennett and because of James Ashley, and because of Kinglsey Burrell and because of Mark Nunes and because of Richard O’Brien and because of the workern Briggs and because of Ricky Bishop and because of Mark Duggan, and because of Joy Gardner and because of Harry Stanley and because of Seni Lewis and because of Christoper Alder, and because of Sheku Ahmed and because of Michael Brown and because of Smiley Culture and because of Ian Tomlinson, and because of Michael Powell and because of Simon Murden and because of Sean Rigg and because of Cherry Groce, and because of Aston Mclean and because of Adrian Thompson and because there were too many more names on top of these that the worker could not summon to mind, though all were too real, and it was because they hated themselves for their inability to memorialise lives that had been stolen − with impunity − from friends and from families that grieved in agony, never to be granted justice; and it was because there had been more than five hundred people killed in police custody and not one person convicted; it was because of Orgreave; it was because of people caged in prisons, it was because of activists who, fighting for truth or for fairness, had been beaten and mocked and treated like cattle; it was because of undercover detectives that lied and ruined honest lives; it was because of Hillsborough, and because of CS gas, and because of rubber bullets and because the Independent Police Complaints Commission was in no way independent; and it was because of stop and search and because of the assumption of an 80 automatic right to their biological data, because, in the name of security, they could and would suspend their law; it was because they had no respect for privacy and because they resolutely refused to countenance the psychological stresses of constant surveillance; it was because the police divulged private information to rapacious media corporations and because they kept the homeless from claiming shelter in empty dwellings; it was because they cared more about the consumption of recreational drugs than the mass expropriation of wealth; and it was because, ultimately, the police were the unwavering foot soldiers of a tepid mediocrity, who defended a miserable status-quo, and this would never change, and the only positive claim they could, if pushed, make for the police was that they were feebler than generally presumed: of course, they possessed inordinate physical force, but they had no mechanism by which to protect against widespread desires, for justice or progress, and, in the worker’s mind, it was this, desire, that would one day defeat them, for every position of desire, no matter how small, was capable of calling into question the established order of a society: not that desire was asocial, on the contrary; but it was explosive; there was no desiring-machine capable of being assembled without demolishing entire social sectors, and the police were but one sector that would be destroyed, and the worker thought about this and thought of saying it aloud to the class but they knew that the officer 81 and the room would most likely contend that they had confused reality with imagery: they would say that, on the ground, life was different to the pictures of constraint and authoritarianism evoked, though the worker knew it was not, that it was filthier and dirtier, and moreover they knew it was the police who in fact traded in metaphor, arousing ideas of order and health and of the overcoming evil to buttress against popular will,",
"and so, docile to their captors, the two siblings were jostled to a black vehicle and driven to a benign looking cul-de-sac, where, once ejected, they momentarily glimpsed a crisp, sunlit day, redolent of growth and imbibed, before they were trudged to a suburban dwelling, hauled within as they traversed bleach-clean hallways bedecked with biscuit-shade carpets and stencil-painted walls and were thrust, stumbling, down a staircase to a dimly lit and cavernous cellar, which lay empty besides the men and their prey, whom, once positioned in the gloom, were kicked to the floor and booted twice more until the two lay still, groaning and teary-eyed, as the men departed to leave them to sob and cling to one another, in coldness and dismay, awake to their imprisonment yet ignorantly terrified of their awaiting ordeal, which though ambiguously poised was to unfold more grimly than anticipated, as untold privations, beatings and violations were delivered, in humiliations and abuses that saw the two tossed, carcass-like, about the room, stripped nude and coerced into debased performances and dances, their bodies scarred by flames and scalpels that etched and tattooed cruelties onto once-soft flesh, crude and personal slurs imprinted thereon for the kidnappers’ pleasure, in rituals that continued, repeatedly and repetitively, there delineated in an obscene and relentless detail that chronicled the pair’s combined slide into diarrhoetic frailty, until, after an indefinable period of distress – lingered upon with writerly relish – one of the two died, starved and limp, such that the siblings no longer faced their torment together as shared 14 witnesses to suffering, comforting one other in respite from savagery, with misery assuaged by solidarity; rather, barbarism was faced in solitude, accepted alone, day upon day, beheld only by a lifeless corpse that blankly lay fetid and motionless before the healthier and older of the two, who eventually, driven desperate with hunger, felt compelled to eat its sibling, its belly ballooned and filthied, teeth piercing the elastic-like sallow peel of the younger kin, greedily gobbling what little tissue remained on the sagging body, such that, while repulsed and spluttering and weeping, the oldest was fed and slept and dreamed of another life, if only briefly, before they were woken for yet further vileness, which elapsed more slowly than typical, endured in intense and screamless brutality, unfolding mercilessly until one of the men announced a desire to conclude and grabbed the remaining victim, who, sodomised and shaking, their rectum bruised and scabrous, with bloody ichor dribbling anus-down, felt their head stiffly rotated in clutching and insuperably strong fingers as they were forced to lick the rancid residue of loose faecal matter from the kidnapper’s member, tasting their own unwashed wretchedness as they vomited and retched and were struck across the face, mockingly probed for their final words, which, after pausing, they released from their gingivitis ridden mouth, their bruised and fractured jawline swollen red, wobbling unclosed as they looked to their oppressor and pawed the inspissating spew from their lips, eyes bleary and wide, hypnotically fixed as they spoke, plaintively, in soft, almost canorous tones, “I will not avenge my humiliation; I will not resist,” they uttered, “no, I will not valiantly cling to life; I will not gain strength, righteousness or goodliness through suffering; I will neither forgive my tormentor and receive salvation, nor will I obtain enlightenment in my final moments; no, I will not benefit spiritually, epistemologically or otherwise; I will die, diseased and degraded and disposed of, subsumed in my entirety, and this is merely how it is, for I am spontaneity and you are order; and history will be no more,'",
"so that if they were to exploit, they supposed, they would do so competently and meticulously, augmenting profit when possible, for if they were doomed to suffer the guilt of their abuses, their misdeeds borne in the burdensome screech of conscience, they thought, they should maximise compensation, placating shame with comfort, there hoarding services and goods to assuage self-reproach, easing all sense of self with the support of value, rendered manifest in the indisputable physicality of consumption; because, if the world was merely an immense accumulation of commodities, its unit being a single commodity, available for trade and exchange, with one’s presence and strength and personality registered in one’s possession thereof, they supposed, then the more one accrued – in clothing and furniture and property – the firmer existence would grow, meaning they were to venerate its logic and prepare their chores with a sense of principle, there determined to inflate their income and to manicure the apartment as best they could, heaving their shopping to the table as they opened a list of jobs, from which they examined the first item, discerned, through scrawled characters and misspellings, to be instruction to inspect paintwork and to measure walls, with the former thought a requirement for redecoration and the latter for purchase of prints, in a strategy contrived upon the tenant’s departure and devised to mask the rooms’ spatial inadequacies, with the worker convinced that artwork, if sufficiently intriguing, if sufficiently internally focused, could distract from the architecture’s material fact, positionable in porthole-like spots that would pierce the new-build’s constrictive monotony, affording the illusion of enchantment in the presentation of a world beyond, for if the prevailing orientation to paintings had managed to have people believe that art floats ten feet above the ground and had nothing to do with the historical situation out of which it had grown – that it could be presumed to be an entity all to itself – then, the worker concluded, such self-containment should be exploited, through the promissory facade of transcendence, rented as the deceptive image of abstraction, whose profits would there return in increased rates and additional revenue, the flat ever costlier for the mere thin mixtures of shape and colour dangled therein, its revenue enlarged by embellishments wrenched from the continuum between the monument and the ornament, with each piece densely symbolic, their ideas paramount and material form secondary, lightweight, ephemeral, cheap, unpretentious, and penetrable to the intellect, though harmonious with apartment’s tone – in cool whites and clean lines – that suggested the transcendence of decoration but complied therewith,",
"and so, bristling with inquisitiveness, they leant sideways to read, positioning themself to greet a word document, which extended beyond a single page with prose divided into three or so even sections – each running to approximately a hundred words in length and carefully spaced – formatted in the program’s default typeface, but without a title, such that their vision fell to the opening unnamed paragraph, whose initial scan disclosed instructions, adumbrating procedures for an undefined subject, with a further glance revealing the other passages to be composed similarly, such that the worker began their perusal of the first with an acute sense of a second and third to follow, in serial form, as they comprehended a plain and unwriterly idiom that articulated what appeared to be directions for torture, in a process whereby a subject – posited in some indeterminate dungeon – was to confront a family member, there stripped nude with ankles attached to four divergent rails, such that the relative’s genitals would protrude, spread wide, as the victim was directed to place its mouth against their anus and lick, informed that refusal or pause – through flinch or vomit – would beget their forcible restraint, their body pinioned as one fingernail was violently detached for each non-compliance, torn with pliers upon the slightest recoil or cessation, and, were this insufficiently deterring, or were all digits exhausted, the same punishment would be meted out to their kin, exposing a familial agony whose image struck the worker as perverse and obnoxious but intriguing, somehow physically energising her, to the extent that they careered to imbibe the next portion of text, pulse rising as eyes advanced to read, there excitedly encountering another nameless passage that, again, articulated orders for enactment on a featureless person, whom in this instance was to be undressed to the waist and to be cast into an empty room, left to linger in its cold, shivering, until boiling sugar syrup was thickened, with its bubbling volume introduced and flung thereover, scolding and blistering their skin before they were abandoned once more, uncovered and without remedy as hungry, stinging insects infiltrated the room, gravitating towards the injured torso, such that the figure was compelled to remain static, despite their agonies, to permit the creatures to tread ticklishly over puss and blood-smeared sores, averting further stings, whose thought induced hot shudders, stretching from spine to temple, as the worker sat unnerved yet enticed,",
"such that the worker, alarmed by the glitch, could only assume the other worker had departed in the elapsed period, that they had abandoned the corridor to convalesce or, alternatively, to complete their suicidal pact in seclusion, with the video’s jump a remedy for delay, yet, whilst contemplating their absence, they saw that the other worker, the self-same labourer, had returned, miraculously unharmed and fully clothed, with their empty bucket in hand, as they positioned themselves as before, their trousers falling yet again, such that the worker soon realised it to be an unchanged replay of the pre-recorded scene, the uniform voiding and expulsion and ingestion routine unfolding once more, with duplicate acts of self-harm following in succession, its repetition watched until, moments before the figure’s first ruinous collision, before the video’s odd cessation, the worker resolved, quickly, to reload the feed, there hoping that refreshment might disclose the truth of the incident, in a contemporary feed of the debased procedure’s aftermath, where the worker’s battered body might be discovered prostrate in the corridor, or charging in the concluding stages of its ritual, or enacting some other condition,",

const thirteenth = ["such that, the worker speculated, the factory would do well to retain some of this sense of possibility within its commodities: they would be good makers if they could only keep the paint as good as it is in the can or the timber as bold as when it arrived, which they did not; instead, they created products that the worker disliked, in conditions they abhorred, and they thought of their hatred of work as they proceeded to perform it, though, later, they would soon swing to an affirmative register, considering alternatives, in the assorted ways in which their job might be improved, reflecting on the measures that might render each tortuously long working day more congenial and more joyful than presently felt, and they concluded that, if permitted, they would introduce greater variety to their daily labour, meaning each shift would be structured around a number of different tasks, such that a few hours would be spent on assembly, several on transportation and several on manufacture, and thus they would be less prone to repetitive strain and would be alleviated the crushing tedium of their daily rhythm; they even thought that subsequent to this reform they might greet portions of the day with enthusiasm too,",
"so that the worker, who hated such order, pondered the limitations of style as they walked toward the shop’s doorway, its speakers there blaring a rendition of a mid-twentieth century soul single, recorded by the winner of a televised singing contest, which had been released to moderate success, and which had been competently produced – in as much as the correct notes had been hit and sections arranged proficiently – yet the worker questioned why fifty year old popular music was here rehashed today, and why it resounded from a clothes retailer too; and thus they questioned the choice of the track and concluded that it had not been decided on at all; of course, the playlist had been selected by professionals and marketers, and the producers had picked a song to perform, but ultimately their hands had been forced by the leaden weight of market habits, since the range of acceptable pleasures in such contexts was finite, they supposed: they were obliged to be reliable, inoffensive and profitable, and, with respect to the music that accompanied consumption, this required that pleasure must not demand any effort and therefore moved rigorously in the worn grooves of association, bulldozing silence, which today criticised society by merely existing;",
"so that they they leant against their chair and attempted to relax, closing their eyes and thinking of their evening meal, which they would soon eat and which they regarded as sustenance rather than pleasure, electing to cook the same simple meal tonight as they did most nights, so that, as they sat immured in contemplation, they looked across the kitchen and noticed that the units had begun to tarnish and discolour and that a greasy outline had formed around the cutlery drawer, prompting them to affirm that were this their property, were they the legal owner, such ugliness would have long since been remedied: they would have maintained the flat better, and would have repaired and replaced that which required restoration with diligence and investment, taking pride in the upkeep of their personal space; though the flat’s slight decay was of little concern to the worker at this juncture, for there had been damages even when they had first inhabited the apartment: a thumb-sized piece of veneer had splintered from the kitchen worktop, four tiles had fallen from the wall, and several of the cupboard hinges had been half-broken, such that their doors hung angled, leaving dark triangular windows when closed, regarded by the worker as vaguely sinister and disliked, and whilst they had wanted to complain of such defects, they had not, fearing that their objections would have sounded more intolerant than they were and that they would have been alienated from the landlord,",
"and so, the worker decided, they were in some sense out to rip out the metaphors, especially those that had to do with “up”, as well as every other whiff of transcendence, for they wanted to amend the terms of debate and expose to others just what exactly the police were, materially and immanently, in the world as it stood; but they kept these thoughts to themselves and sat noiselessly as the lesson − which consisted of the policeman’s speech, a question and answer session, and a series of small group exercises – elapsed, pondering the things they would say were they pushed into debate, such that by the time the class had finished they had refined watertight articulate retorts to the hypothetical statements their interlocutors might make, though they made none, and the worker said nothing too until the end of period bell,",
"and thus their soliloquy ceased and the three men silently glanced to one another and gripped the beleaguered body, striking thereupon with repeated thwacks of fists and boots, hammering persistently until ribcage and consciousness and skull gave way, shattered and concave, seeping soft scarlets onto the concrete floor to coagulate in puddles of marbled pink and umber as the sibling died and the story ended, which left the worker dumbfounded and aghast, uncertain of their response and alarmed and confused, on untold levels, but mostly eager to determine the student responsible for the text, immediately turning to discover their previously hidden identity, frantically skimming through each sheet marked and unmarked in a process of elimination, fingers flicking, until, after counting, they saw that several of the class – at least six – had failed to submit work, such that, even once this handful were winnowed out, the problem of attribution remained, which they attempted to resolve but failed, unable to attach any of the unaccounted names to the writing, knowing their work, their syntax, their style, and that it diverged from the expressive yet hateful account of torture read moments ago, and that their class, of unfocused Emmas and ever-uncooperative Connors, were unlikely to have sat in stoic concentration and written so voluminously, irrespective of the piece’s content, which in all its repugnant design and grisly particularity further foiled attribution, the worker unable to imagine student contriving such detailed and gruesome text, images from which returned to them now, unfurling in their chaotic aggregate, as wrists were clamped and nails hammered between knuckles, as urine splashed the lineaments of a weeping face, and as an emaciated body was forced to twirl – as if to music – whilst electrical cables whipped, plug pins lacerating its jaundiced chest to leave the worker physically sickened, nauseous, as they continued to search for a name to attach thereto, for a student whose psyche could have conduced such prose, thinking of their class and of the life that precipitated this work, for if art came from a kind of experimental condition in which one experiments with living, they thought, then this demanded reflection on the writing’s underpinning experimental iniquity, on whether it was actively seized or was suffered in the abuse of a friend or relative, or was passively absorbed from a hyperviolent reservoir of computer games and extreme pornography, discovered whilst browsing, where cheap production rendered simulation and suffering indiscernible, in tears and in punches and coerced participation, which, if responsible, framed the writing not as a dark indulgence but as the cathartic processing of an imaged violence: as an almost healthy response to the immanent weight of a sadism that permeated even the most innocuous details of domestic life, from catalogue-bought furniture to hearty repast alike, demanding cognitive digestion in written expositions of violent gratification, whose undertaking ought well to be construed as sanative and not deviant, however oblique its therapy might seem, which they thought should alleviate them of any duty to intervene, though the possibility that the work belonged to experience remained, they supposed, besieging them with thoughts of lived deprivation and abuse internalised through years of clandestine barbarism, delivered at the hands of a peer or parent or acquaintance, troubling them with the necessity of response: to act, to contact the author’s guardian, in an imperative that left the worker further disordered, for if the author resided within an abusive household a parental phone call would only risk further harm – if the abuser caught wind of the writing’s explicitness and sought punishment, or if they were prompted to launch accusations of disclosure and wreak vengeance – and, thus, considering the potential imprudence of familial intervention but the obligation to react, the worker judged social services a better option, with their relation to the school vaguely recalled from a hurriedly scanned child protection document, long since folded and discarded, and whose precise procedural details eluded them as they considered their report on the student and their interactions with them, the contemplation of which elicited the further realisation that their classroom routine had unfolded with complete indifference to their suffering, with lessons delivered in boorish oblivion to the harshness and dolour endured, ignorant of the stigmata of trauma borne in the student’s answers and mannerisms and prior assignments, which if parsed diligently and without concern for hastily finishing their work – without their haughty dismissal and reduction to a preconceived idea of literary homogeneity – might have unveiled the hellacious reality supressed from view, such that intervention had been possible yet had been missed, which there left the worker momentarily overcome with shame and contrition, abashed at their readerly hubris and their post-work proclivity to disregard; though, upon thinking thereof, whilst mired in speculation, they came to question their discomfiture, somehow unsure as to whether the writing indexed misery at all, uncertain as to whether accumulated abuse could be read into the assignment or whether it arose from the murky pits of the imagination, from some spring beyond or before reminiscence, for ultimately, without additional evidence, there was little reason to construe direct experience as responsible; rather, such a supposition merely testified to their own low expectations of pupils, grounded in the conjecture that novelty would arise only from the particularities of authorial biography, as if reproduced from memory without the genial interference of creativity, in a force they had longed to affirm, with the worker there loath to deny originality without justification;",
"so that, when photographed and displayed, in estate agent’s website and shop, the home presented a coherent picture of future happiness, maintaining the fictive potential by which property circulated, its bits and pieces put together to form the semblance of a whole, which would advertise a reconciled seamlessness, in a life of comfort and joy and progress that was never to arise yet remained stronger for its absence, there considered as the worker began their tasks, wandering between rooms to report where required restoration and where frames might best sit, imagining possible purchases as they returned to the kitchen to retrieve tools from their bag, doing so until they felt the soft vibration of phone against flesh, the motorised tickle there prompting them to open its screen,",
"such that she, again, proceeded to peruse, eager to plunge deeper through the textual well of sadism, their thirst unslaked, intensified even, as they reached a third identically-sized section, in which the singular subject was to be tethered to a chair with neck and mouth braced, their lips prised apart and throat opened gapingly to the dull, loveless room, there stationed beside a modest table, upon which an array of hand tools were huddled, with screwdrivers, hammers and saws, and a bottle of bleach separated to the left, such that the subject was instructed to choose therebetween, to point, with their unconstrained finger, in either a leftwards direction – engendering consumption of bleach – or to the right – to beget dental disfigurement – as one object upon another was selected to assault the subject’s mouth, a steel file slowly turning enamel to dust, grinding upon bloodied oral tissue, or a screwdriver stabbed into gum, levered to remove teeth, so that the subject was forced to decide between the irreparable, potentially lethal consumption of poison or an improvised mutilation, the strange unpleasantness of which startled, but which, much as before, engendered the worker’s feral compulsion to resume, the document’s odd cruelties arousing an inexplicable attraction; yet, upon returning to the text, they saw the next directive extended beyond the page, in a manner that obliged scrolling, and that troublingly required a haptic interaction, in a gentle stroke of the cursor, appearing to violate some complex of physical taboos, such that the worker there looked to the carriage, to where the computer’s owner remained absent and to where no remnant passenger returned their glance, the train’s inhabitants absorbed in their own screen-based frivolity, oblivious as they gladly resolved to indulge their curiosity and decisively, yet furtively, inched their finger towards the trackpad, quickly flicking to reveal the opening of a second page, on which the short passage continued, its body begun with instruction to kidnap and to starve, and to sequester for several days, rendering the subject desperate, so that, with belly bloated from hunger, protuberant and cramping, they would encounter four separate, shining cloches, each raised slowly to unveil a captioned choux bun, whose interiors were there detailed, with the first labelled a mixture of custard and razor blades, the second as the congealed semen of an elderly syphilitic man, the third as the bloodied faeces of a disease-ridden sow, and the last as the intact severed hand of a human foetus, from which they were to choose and to eat, with the added provision that pastries were to be consumed in a maximum of two mouthfuls, so that their shell could not be nibbled free of repulsive content but was to be swallowed in its integral whole, this rule enforced with the threat of perpetual confinement or death, the notion of which the worker experienced with an odd feeling of embodiment, as an uneasily corporeal reception took hold, as what was previously neutral became actual, while what was previously an image became a thing, gnawing its way through psyche to sensation, as wafts of putrid stench circulated from the prose to body,",
"so that, inputting the requisite shortcuts, with fingers prancing over keyboard, they brought forth a livestream, which revealed neither injury nor mess, nor the other worker, but only a bleach-clean hallway, dotted with meandering conversing bodies, with all sign of violence or transgression removed, such that, there, overcome with perplexity, the worker hurriedly moved to rewind, frantically seeking reversal; yet, once again, the error message emerged, prompting them to repeat the procedure and to fail, there falling panicked and feverish, desperate to overcome the malfunction, though with no recourse thereto, the system’s dead chime reverberant, adamant and recalcitrant, as its peal sounded to confirm the past’s succession, such that the worker soon realised it to be an unchanged replay of the pre-recorded scene, the uniform voiding and expulsion and ingestion routine unfolding once more, with duplicate acts of self-harm following in succession, its repetition watched until, moments before the figure’s first ruinous collision, before the video’s odd cessation, the worker resolved, quickly, to reload the feed, there hoping that refreshment might disclose the truth of the incident, in a contemporary feed of the debased procedure’s aftermath, where the worker’s battered body might be discovered prostrate in the corridor, or charging in the concluding stages of its ritual, or enacting some other condition, such that one ought not to mourn the elapsed, they reasoned, but to address the present, there contriving possible responses to the worker’s self-degradation, to their absence and the incident’s strangeness, considered, as they scoured the system’s cameras in the hope of locating their whereabouts, scanning eyes over room after room – through recreation area and machine station alike – with neither sign nor symptom spotted, where abnormality’s absence prompted the worker to turn to the database of employees, to upload its register to identify the image of the worker, momentarily assured until – upon perusal of the record – they found themself unable to discern their appearance, their specificities somehow evanescent under examination, its detail lost as the index of faces fell suddenly homogenous, the worker there overcome with a sense of futility whilst they trawled its reams of indistinct photographs, scrolling without purpose, past machine operative and cleaner and security guard, before they abandoned the pursuit, disappointed, though resolved, nevertheless, to act in some capacity, concluding that a written report would suffice – if only temporarily – since managerial vigilance might later disclose the afternoon’s events, they thought, with fragmentary patches of evidence compiled to smooth doubt’s crest, prompting them to open an incident form with optimism, 89 cheerily inputting their name and the date and time before approaching its largest text-box – reserved for event description – wherein they entered an opening clause, which they retracted upon completion, there stricken with doubt, unsure as to how they should frame the incident and uncertain as to the style they should adopt, since, in light of the abnormality, their prose required plausibility, as otherwise recollections of the blunt mutilation and scatological feast might read as concocted, too fantastical to be believed, penned and submitted as an unprofessional joke or provocation or, worse, as a symptom of nascent madness, whose malignance, other’s could only assume, would intensify, metastasising such that they warranted demotion or dismissal,",

"and thus, whilst longing for hush, the worker wandered beyond the shop, with an empty clenching feeling prickling their stomach, reminding their that they had yet to eat and the they should enter the nearby supermarket to buy lunch: ordinarily the outlet’s advertised “meal deal”, which afforded a sandwich, drink and snack for three pounds, and which they prepared to buy, greeting a warm waft of thick air upon entry as they eased toward the refrigerated to-go section of the shop, selecting a tuna roll with lemonade and chocolate before hurrying to the self-scan to pay, where they thudded fingertips into a touch screen and elected to use their debit card, reluctant to weight their pockets with change and eager to leave, which they did, hurriedly, pacing along the pavement to a square, where they found the bench at which they ordinarily perched and there ate, enacting the ritual customary of lunch, sitting and chomping through inexpensive food whilst imagining something else entirely, finding themselves somehow beset with melancholy midway through its undertaking, saddened and overcome, endowed with an acute sense of degradation at the thought that their life in all its tedious procedure – that had budded with neither thought nor nurture – was entirely fruitless: she had never desired their routine, not its loneliness, and not their environment, neither the mass-produced food nor its tepid flavourlessness, yet somehow they performed its motions with unflinching regularity, seldom considering its repetitions, there half-expectant that forthcoming years would render its chronic banality forgotten, because the worker could not consider their protocol and their job and their current friends legitimate defining facts of their person; rather, they felt themselves above them, as if present life was somehow illusory and contrived, as if a sort of makeshift reality to endure until true life – smiling and lurking nearby – would rear its head to envelope them in a year or two, once they had fallen into a career or a family or had found some sense of purpose to which to be nailed, where, gravid with meaning and liveliness, they would amass friends and acquaintances and people with whom they could converse and flourish, whom were absent from life as it stood, in their world of vapid muddling, which, at moments like this, struck their as somehow implausible: how could it be, they wondered, that there could be so little to their adult existence, so few possibilities for engagement or betterment, and how could this continue indefinitely, for they had left education stirred and animated by the possibilities of independence and the world at large and had been eager to establish a lively social routine that would see their wake 37 each morning with buoyancy and with hope, but satisfaction had failed to emerge; instead, the worker had postponed its arrival, believing that passing years would bequeath an efflorescent sociality of their own: a life replete with conversation and intrigue, though time had refused to, and their sense of morale had withered, replaced by a perpetual stasis that rendered the worker alert to the crushing heft of futility upon her, positioned as though the future promised only endurance and monotony and as though the labours of constructing an enjoyable existence were so completely insurmountable that it was foolish even to try,",
"such that they had held their tongue and had waited for the dull weight of practice to assuage their complaints instead, and, gradually, daily praxis had smoothed the extremity of their disposition, so that they now regarded the kitchen’s existence as one of pure utility rather than sullied decoration, which was remarkable, for the worker had previously held high standards of cleanliness and appearance,",
"upon which they stood and quickly made their way to the door, departing into a fine and clement day, there aware that break had begun and that to avoid interacting with their friends, with whom they did not particularly wish to engage, they ought to leave the college site, which they did, striding beyond the charcoal gates and toward the cornershop, where they passed an unfranchised and cheap fried chicken outlet and a dilapidated Victorian terrace whose buildings stood in various states of disrepair, with some showing boarded windows and others overgrown gardens, which they speculated would soon be scoured and renovated as the burgeoning buy-to-let market devoured the properties and spewed them out, fragmented, as beige and laminate flats, which, the worker concluded, they would not mind inhabiting themself, despite their qualms: they were preferable to their mother’s house, they were private and adult and, because of their location, they would allow them to wander into town at a moment’s notice, to bars and shops, and they were situated opposite a newsagents, and that alone rendered them more convenient than their present abode, which, it seemed, was isolated and sequestered from anything they might want, such that they dwelt on its seclusion as they approached the door of the store and placed their hand on the glaucous metal frame to enter, acknowledging the shop’s familiar bleep as they trudged towards the lines of soft drinks assembled in the fridge, there parsing an almost exhaustive array of carbonated beverages, skimming their eyes over coke and sparkling water and cherryade and cream soda, and loud tropical cans and dark malt drinks in glass bottles too, stood next to white pints of milk and emerald aloe vera infused liquids that they concluded they did not want, eventually there deciding upon a grapefruit-flavoured beverage, which was inexpensive and which they took to the front of the store to purchase, handing two twenty pence pieces to the shopkeeper as they caught a waft of the day-old samosas perched on the counter, thanking the attendant before softly exiting to the road, where, with quarter of an hour until class began, they put in earphones to wile away time, browsing music downloaded to their phone before settling on an album of ambient electronic music for the circuitous route to campus,",
"and so, plagued with doubt, they elected to postpone the social services protocol and instead resolved to consult members of staff in the morning: a move designed to defer responsibility and to allay anxieties, the mere prospect of which left them lighter and unburdened, happy to rise and recover their moussaka from the oven, there relieved as they imagined their colleague’s ardent arrogation of the problem, as they pictured their adroit kindliness, handling student and careworker and family alike in a humane and punctilious investigation, contentedly envisaged as they grasped the steaming ready-meal and a cupboard-cold plate and slid the former to the latter in a smooth arcing motion, permitting the béchamel topped stew to slump and cool whilst they idled, pleased at the prospect of food and of the assignment’s resolution, momentarily serene until it occurred to them that any internal enquiry would inevitably beget inspection of their own conduct too, given he, as teacher, had been partly responsible for the pornographic submission and so would undergo some form of disciplinary action, with their forgotten lesson plans and flippant utterances subject to scrutiny, the possible outcome of which remained uncertain as different eventualities floated in protracted and unpredictable garlands of consequence, extending from demotion to redundancy to disgrace, envisioned as they stood passenger to speculative peregrination, twisting and knotting its path as if there was nothing there to exhaust: it was endless the way a road might be, so that every possible action appeared to harbour malign effect beyond comprehension and control,",

"such that, for that brief moment, there was no outside-text; rather, the page emerged to enclose them in its psychotic phantasmagoria, swirling a dense and hallucinatory fog, thick and impenetrable, until a man, several seats ahead, disgorged a loud, phlegm-muffled cough to wake her, there alerting them to their indiscretion and prompting them to turn stiffly sideward, to the window then their laptop, upon which they sought to focus their vision, embarrassed and acutely aware of the transgression, yet unable to think beyond the images ingested, plagued with doubts and questions, and with a sustained desire to read further, there persistent as they ruminated on the document’s purpose and origin, for with neither clear title nor additional information – with malice merely serially repeated – the text’s function remained obscure, abandoning the worker to speculation and conjecture, there hypothesising that the writing might outline plans for forthcoming crimes, intended for exaction on an indeterminate subject or succession thereof, whom would be captured and enslaved, or that the instructions might not, their description extant merely as a therapeutic remainder through which inscription appeased a deep, internal darkness: a sublimated violence – which would otherwise erupt into fleshly danger – so that the writing had been undertaken for private use, and lacked an intended audience; though, they supposed, it could simply be creative writing too, engineered to outrage, to test the limits of acceptability, in its plain-worded cruelty, and constructed as a work in its own right, or as a dislocated fragment of some longer piece, in which obscenity ruptured an otherwise placid tone, whereby its creator – the absent ill-dressed man – constituted a provocateur, if they were the author, which, they supposed they might not be, for the words could have been pilfered from elsewhere, downloaded from internet forums or extracted from books, penned by the dead or by friends, or compiled in a collectively authored project too, with the beer drinker merely one of many perverted contributors, there appending fantasies to a grim compendium of desires, such that the document  indexed a clandestine network of sadists, somehow spectrally immanent; though, equally, they thought, it might not, for without further contextual determination, without the clear concretion of detail, the document – in provenance and design, in authorship and use – remained radically uncertain, mysterious as an impenetrable inventory of provocations that left the worker unsure of their response, there anxious in the shadow of ambiguity yet eager to view the computer’s owner once again, convinced that scrutiny of their appearance would secure some conclusion, adamant that mere physical proximity would do so, much as the very thought of dialogue troubled,",
"so that they there pondered the means by which they might display validity, in a lack of invention, concluding that detail was vital, for only through a lingering fixation upon the otherwise insignificant aspects of the episode, in a micrologically fine elucidation, could they demonstrate the writing’s veracity, in a precision sufficient to render any theory of confabulation unthinkable,",

const fifteenth = ["and thus, surveying the room, in which workers proceeded in typical fashion, visibly untroubled by the monotony of repetition, steelyeyed and automaton-like in their function, the worker found themselves wondering whether similar thoughts reverberated in their minds too: whether they dreamed of or expected any improvement in their daily routine, or whether they accepted it, and they thought that, although they seldom spoke of it, they possibly did: perhaps all workers were alike: they dreamed of doing something more social, more collaborative, more real than their job, something in which they were neither distant nor removed from their task, in which they oversaw production, distribution and consumption and obtained a perfect comprehension of the work and their products, and, there, the worker felt that access to greater information would further improve their job, for their ignorance of the furniture’s had always troubled, because, much as they toiled diligently, each working day, on similar products, whose construction they could recount flawlessly – from timber to rivet to bolt – he, nevertheless, had yet to receive an explication of their work’s place within the wider world of goods, of how it was lived with and by whom,",
"so that they there sat overwhelmed, harbouring both a desperate sense of the necessity of change and a pessimism that denied its likelihood, which centred on their job, where existence unfolded in the customer service department of a tawdry online retailer, whose employees neither knew nor valued her, and whose office was arranged to the rigid strictures of hierarchy, with endless managers erected above to remind their of their place, and of their dispensability and their role, which was to answer questions with pre-programmed responses that they selected as if incapable of independent thought, since were they to demonstrate their capabilities – their facility to write with originality and sensitivity – they knew they could expect to be disciplined and cautioned and demeaned and threatened with poverty, like any precarious worker whose tongue wriggled unbitten, and so the worker was forced to submit to the governance of the company’s leaders, resentful of their power, feeling that to be governed was to be watched, inspected, spied upon, directed, law-driven, numbered, regulated, enrolled, indoctrinated, preached at, controlled, checked, estimated, valued, censured, commanded, by creatures who have neither the right nor the wisdom nor the virtue to do so; to be governed was to be at every operation, at every transaction noted, registered, counted, taxed, stamped, measured, numbered, assessed, licensed, authorized, admonished, prevented, forbidden, reformed, corrected, punished; it was, under pretext of utility, and in the name of business interest, to be placed under contribution, drilled, fleeced, exploited, monopolized, extorted from, squeezed, hoaxed, robbed; then, at the slightest resistance, the first word of complaint, to be repressed, fined, vilified, harassed, hunted down, abused, clubbed, disarmed, bound, choked, imprisoned, judged, condemned, shot, deported, sacrificed, sold, betrayed; and to crown all, mocked, ridiculed, derided, outraged, dishonoured; that was government; that was its justice; that was its morality, and the worker loathed it,",
"and, thus, they considered just how their tolerance for the room – for its tattiness and decrepitude – had been fashioned from circumstance, born of a mixture of property rights and timorousness: he had been too diffident to register their dissatisfaction with the condition of the apartment and had consequently reconciled themselves to living in a visibly deteriorating flat, which was degrading only on account of the landlord’s whims, for much as the worker may have used the flat, much as they may have felt and lived through it, it was not by law their and they could thus never implement substantive change to the property without consent – ever ungranted – such that they were unable to retile or repaint, even though the work was needed and desired by the worker, who alone dwelled in the flat, deciding each day how it ought to be used and practiced; instead, the contract stipulated that the flat was to remain unaltered and was to be left in a condition comparable to that in which it had first been rented, so that future tenants might rent it as the worker had, clean and clear and devoid of human residue, permitting them to believe they had stumbled into some magically new and ghostless abode, where the remnants of life had been expunged or strained below the surface, so that the worker’s lived warmth was to evanesce, their life in all its material remainder there legally bound for erasure, as use without memory, a tenancy as apparition;",
"such that, with heavy white-noise laden sounds pulsating, the worker meandered close to college, absorbing nearby sights of garish billboards and litter-speckled bushes, calibrating the music with images passed, as if directing a film, so that, for a brief period, they heard with their eyes and saw with their ears, transforming their journey into a strange cinematic realm, undeniably other to the absolute space of their regular journey, for their ears, which normally informed their of the world behind their and beyond their eye-line, had been diverted from their usual function, as the music cocooned her, positing the worker at the centre of an altogether different place, where they saw the world as flatter, as a screen, with only one side and where, without knowledge of its reverse, they achieved distance from their habitual environment, rested in an altered, monadic stretch, and they thought about the ways in which this allowed them to see the world anew, contemplating whether they had stumbled upon something radical or retreative: whether the exit from regular life constituted a form of escapism, a wilful ignorance of the faults of the world, or whether it offered a position from which to grasp the ugly truth of reality and to effect change,",
"meaning that, on the cusp of despondency, they supposed they might simply not act at all: instead, they thought, they might treat the assignment like any other, because, ultimately, the assignment could be less exceptional than judged: other staff might have regularly encountered assignments comparable in content, or more intense still, for maybe students often plumbed the hollows of extremity and only their teaching inhibited their transgressions, perhaps most of the work now was involved with a denial of any kind of absolute morality and violence and sexuality was the norm, and perhaps they were somehow more conservative and less capable of nurturing difference than their fellow teachers, whose tutelage opened pupils to experimentation and emboldened prose to roam impulsively, without self-censorship; yet this conflicted with recollections of past faculty meetings, in the discussions of set texts and starter activities that had disclosed the staff’s deeply planted traditionalisms with respect to meaning, where students’ work had been constructed around a notion of intention, in a way that pointed directly inward: to the privacy of a mental space, such that the teachers seemed to expect truly creative writing to arise from a pre-programmed, almost robotic method, without montage or grammatical irregularity, in a manner that struck them as depressingly conservative, its rigidity unlikely to conduce little, if any, writing of merit, since such work required the transcendence of tedious repetition, with novel prose neither specifiable nor knowable in advance: it refused to conform to any check-list-like inventory of characteristics,",
"and so, frantically, they combed their phone for an address, hoping to obtain either street name or house number, or a vague allusion to location, hurriedly perusing instant messaging exchanges to find only generalities, there confronting the paucity of information transmitted, with neither date nor place nor surname referenced whatsoever, inducing panic, as the worker fell unsure of their actions, there inclined to beckon the police,",

const sixteenth = ["so that the worker, who was otherwise familiar with every aspect of the factory’s commodities, struggled to envision the consumer who might purchase and use their labour’s result; and though they had of course seen pictures of the rooms in which such furniture ideally resided, with domestic pictures ubiquitous throughout the company’s literature, they personally knew of no one that had bought such a coffee table or chair or sofa themselves: they had only recently gathered that the furniture was intended for export to Europe, presumably for bodies more affluent, more salubrious than their own, which left the worker burdened with a heightened sense of alienation; though, still, they found solace in the idea that their job brought pleasure somewhere, for someone, because the alternative – that work was nugatory and senseless – threatened to render the day less bearable than it was, such that the worker now found and kept a single photograph of each product they had worked on, to remind themselves of their work’s utility, tearing prints from boxes and collecting creased papers from the floor, meaning that they had amassed a bulging scrapbook of company products, some documented against a white and alien infinity screen and others in strange, contrived mise en scène displays, with each image serving as prompt to recall the value of their job and to recall that the pain in their shoulders and the crick in their wrist and the mind numbing boredom they endured was not groundless, that they did not toil pointlessly on objects that were incinerated for the dark pleasures of some slave-owning master, but, rather, their labour remained in the world and improved life, wherever it was that such things were purchased, meaning that if the worker was licensed to change yet another aspect of their job, they thought, they would somehow close that distance between maker and user, rendnering both appreciable to each other, and this, they concluded, would improve their and their colleagues’ situation; but, abruptly, their mood there shifted, as if a switch had flicked, turning optimism to melancholy, as they considered the notion of improvement and advancement, and supposed that even these changes might not beget greater happiness, for as much as workers might dream of improvement, they conjectured, the gains made in working conditions inevitably fell from appreciation at some point: the ecstasy of victory was slowly overcome by routine and repetition – by the deadening effect of daily praxis – which inexorably rendered collective achievement invisible and banal, leaving work to feel much as it ever did, defined by compulsion and drudgery and remote from its ideal, and that which seemed good would seem foul and they would only desire more as triumph was consumed by an unrelenting thirst for betterness, of which the worker remained unsure, for, while such desire did, on the one hand, ensure continual progress, increasing the ambitions and appetites of struggle, it evaded satisfaction and denouement, on the other, requiring ever further energy to continue its advance, regardless of perceived contentment,",
"though upon consideration, they thought, it was ultimately the precise character of their labour they disliked most of all, the work being such that they were compelled to undertake tedious, meaningless activity without deviation and without end, their job offering little room for expression or personality, and typified by its compulsions and absent fulfilment, the recollection of which impelled them to ponder the very idea of work at all, a concept which struck their as stretched between two divergent poles: one defined by onerousness and another by ludicness, such that in performing supposedly similar things, jobs, they felt there existed a spectrum that permitted every affect from optimism to boredom to dread, with the worker stationed unfalteringly at its negative terminus, as one who hated their labour, with neither the power to engender transformation nor any hopes thereof, for opportunities were scarce and their CV – their potential passage from tedium – did little but advertise a capacity for repetition, rendering them unable to attain desirable employ; instead, they were helplessly confined to their putrid office, where they poked their keyboard each day, lubricating the sale of purportedly modern furniture, responding to customers whose only knowledge of the products came from a digital image and from a short paragraph of descriptive text, which had, at best, been supplemented by a correspondence with her, in an email that doubtlessly prevaricated to protect the company from legal action, such that the worker knew their work eluded any sense of public interest; rather, they worked in the interest of business, unaligned with the desires of ordinary buyers, with almost every aspect of their work orchestrated to alienate their from clients – in the quotas they were obliged to hit and the time pressures imposed thereupon – such that the worker struggled to imagine any purpose to their job, to even picture a living client or a concrete commodity,",
"yet – upon consideration of this predicament – the worker concluded that the procedure was more complicated than supposed, because, if the owner had wanted to retain the apartment’s spotlessness, they would have had to have conducted the minor repairs the worker had wanted, since these left undone betrayed its use; and, besides, the worker had deposited so many minuscule traces of their life in this building that it could never be cleansed completely: their footsteps had thinned the floorboards in the hall, their bedframe had grazed, scratchily, against the wallpaper, and their cooking had deposited fatty splodges, dotted across the kitchen’s eggshell paintwork; and the litany of blemishes continued, to the extent that the worker failed to see how they could ever be disentangled from the flat, whether by landlord or by other, and so, they thought, it was a madness to attempt such dislocation, even if those involved involved in the next lease or sale of the flat would inevitably pretend to do so, for everyone – buyers, sellers, lawmakers, and even they themselves – was a mystic rather than a rationalist now, and they believed that their powers extended back into history, into the death mask of the past, where they could force the flat, as commodity, to begin its life afresh, with the chime of a cash register, whenever they desired; though, ultimately, they could not: the sediment lingered, and the materiality of the building divulged that which had elapsed, whispering and wearing the dead labours of yesterday, such that the worker there thought any pretence of newness bizarre, yet they supposed there must have been a time when this had not been the norm, when it had been accepted that others were to live alongside that which was not theirs and that things would be blended with persons, moving in and out of life in motions and diversions, in a swerve that was merely responded to, as people accommodated the strange changing of things and of history with propriety and honesty,",
"and thus their mind there projected countless possibilities, considering the division here posited between inside and outside and the manner in which this new internal space, proffered by earphones, was, only graspable as internality from the knowledge of its outside, and how that outside too was only intelligible from another position of distance, so that the constitution of this bubble, their sonic chrysalis, struck their as a complex and contradictory affair, and they continued to relfect thereupon as they placed their empty can in a litter bin and wandered through the college gates, into the building where break had finished and where a handful of students remained, loitering and chatting in the corridors, speaking of pleasures and of nothingness as the worker passed to head for the library, in which they decided they would use their free period to catch up on outstanding homework, arriving to find that it too was nearly deserted, with no more than ten students at work, listening to music as they wrote on square wooden tables, arranged so that roughly six people might sit, secluded and surrounded by shoulder-height book shelves, which the worker passed before securing an empty desk, there opening their frayed media studies file to examine their homework: “preparation for major project”, which was on this occasion a music video and which was work that their teacher had failed to delineate, having never articulated exactly what was required of the class by next lesson,",
"and so, they maintained, work need only be interesting, it could inhabit diverse forms, employ montage, experimental punctuation, or indulge in page-length digressions, or develop characters, or not, with or without its self-recursion, because there were no defined criteria for interest, and had there been it would have made little difference, because aesthetics was to students as ornithology is to birds: a codified, irrelevant aside, without which writing functioned contentedly, the few remotely novel contributions submitted evincing little deference to formal doctrines of quality, there written as if conceived by mystics rather than rationalists, whom they considered as they swept forkfuls of overcooked yet tepid moussaka towards their face, cream and umber daubs furnishing the corners of their mouth until, once finished, and satisfactorily swollen, they smeared themself clean and carted their plate to the sink, where they rinsed the crockery and brushed lazily and incompletely, such that discoloured water lacquered its residual tomato streaks, dormant as they pictured tomorrow’s class, whom they expected to encounter as unresponsive to instruction and reluctant to work as ever, to whose apathy they had long since been resigned, believing that all students were alike: they dreamed of doing something more social, more collaborative, more real than the tasks imposed on them,",
"until, on the verge of dialling, with finger poised on key, they realised that the video could not have depicted recent suicide, for their interlocutor had sent a prerecorded sequence, appended with an invitation to watch, meaning they could not be dying or fatally wounded, and that they could not have recently crumpled – castrated – to ground, because the phone had not filmed in real time, with its images premade, such that the mutilation had not ended life but had been survived and shared with others, which solicited further questioning thereof: of the purpose and yearning behind the behaviour, and of the status of previous interactions, and of their eroticised dialogue, which, in the aftermath of maiming, struck the worker as inexplicable, as a counter-intuitive denial of bodily lust, though, quickly, they reasoned, the concupiscent discourse need not have intimated copulation but could have referenced stranger, alien structures of compulsions, irreducible to mere somatic satisfaction, in more potent urges still, thrown forward by the conquering force of desire, which cared neither for health nor stability nor permanence but only for its self-sovereignty, because, they thought, every position of desire, no matter how small was capable of calling into question the established order of a society: not that desire was asocial, on the contrary; it was explosive: there was no desiring-machine capable of being assembled without demolishing entire social sectors, corporeality there impotent before its world-crushing power, with soma left frangible like dirt; yet, still, the worker struggled to envisage the psychological condition that begot such self-disfigurement, their thinking unable to imagine an affective condition conducive to its caustic abandonment, whether through misery or wrath, so that the determination to disfigure seemed insoluble, its opacity importunate as they tried, in desperation, to construe an underpinning personality, inventing a sender’s biography and disposition and cogitating, intently,",
"such that they supposed the display was intentional, left as a confession, or as a lure for fellow fetishists, to read and make contact, to contribute to its world of fantastical pain; or, likewise, it might constitute a libidinally-charged taunt or boast of wrongdoings, its exhibition indicative of a desired dispersal, which troubled as much as if for personal use, they felt, there discomforted by the idea of its dissemination, so that they considered moving seats, though they did not but elected to remain instead, aware that a mid-carriage confrontation might ensue were the author to return, were they to trudge through the vehicle and notice her, meaning they simply sat still, pensive and indecisive, whilst pondering the prose beside her, awash in speculation as they considered every aspect of the instructional script, which had permeated all thoughts to contort their innermost visions,",

"so that, in an attempt to amend their ignorance, they there strove to envision the altogether alien moment when, weeks after purchase, a three dimensional hunk of stuff arrived, emptied from transit, to displace or replace whatever had hitherto sat in the customer’s home, as what was previously neutral became actual, while what was previously an image became a thing, material and dumb; though no more mute, they supposed, than the light and colour and lines parsed in promotional materials, such that the worker then felt obliged to consider the role played by photographs in their job too, as one of the few links between customers and themself, between their desk and consumers, who browsed and chose furniture from the knowledge garnered from images, contacting them with further enquiries – of details undepicted and colours misleadingly lit – before they made their purchase and awaited delivery, which would or would not fulfil expectations, meaning that the worker felt these images not only connected clients and traders but also bridged present and future too, spawning a vision of tomorrow, so that, distilled within rectangular jpegs, within petty leaves of paper, unmoved and dead to the sweep of history, there trickled a sense of anticipation and of time to come, drawing the worker to reflect further on the strangeness of pictures, on their bizarre and abstract spatiality, because, much as images appeared contained, bounded and quadrilateral when shown, they were of course spread across innumerable times and places, taking flight from camera and computer, in a studio, and blossoming into countless different forms, printed in magazines and on company correspondences, uploaded to websites and downloaded by thousands, projected through innumerable monitors and smart phones, in the street and at work, on adverts, in hotel lobbies and through Google searches, where they were seen in urban and rural locales and learnt in the minds of people, who, whilst bored and whilst occupied, conversed with loved ones to impart further images too, as words, like pixels, accreted into pictures, ready for dialogue with screens and catalogues, whereupon their instantiation they would elicit disappointment or excitement or nothing, educing a host of affects as myriad as the photograph itself, whose multiplicity had led the worker to question just how pictures could remain singular and static in spite of the variances of their realisation, which, though manifold, they thought, were annihilated in the concept of the selfsame image, which erased all but the illusion of a single photograph, in such a regard as to promise hope and tragedy, constructing a common object to anticipate a shared world whilst erasing individuality in the process, such that the images could be regarded with both warmth and fear in theory, depending on the context they were thought in, for theories were made only to die in the war of time, they thought, with ambivalences that would resolve upon the passing of history, such that, with social or mental revolution, future persons might look back and laugh at the folly of their age, at the quaintness and parochialism of its ideas, so that the worker felt an acute sense of thought’s insufficiency, there thinking that today’s reason was little but bumbling in the shadow of some looming breakthrough, as if only fruitless pondering before enlightenment dawned,",
"such that, then, whilst staring, they considered the kitchen table at which they had sat hundreds of times before and upon which they had eaten and cried and laughed, and they wondered what would become of it, once it was not his, when it was rented or sold, thinking of how it was to be traded without remembrance, as new, treated as if it was something entirely different to that which it was before, acquiring an amnesia in exchange much the same as when it first left the factory, whereupon, it stood on its head, and there then evolved out of its wooden brain grotesque ideas, far more wonderful than if it had begun to dance of its own free will: ideas of independence and power, of constancy and selfhood, which the worker felt had somehow stuck upon the world and were now lodged in the bowels of consumer and consumed alike, and they thought of this as they looked at the kitchen and surveyed its walls and its floor and its ceiling, which though largely white and cream felt somehow claustrophobic and close, seeming to press inwards in a constriction that left them unusually absorbed in context, the room collapsing to render the worker almost indistinguishable from environment: it was as though they covered every inch of their kitchen at once, their body co-extensive with the dimensions of the room,",
"so that the worker there pondered what they ought to do, quickly concluding that they would write a description of the piece they had imagined, their task being ambiguous in the absence of definite instruction, though, ultimately, they reasoned, almost anything would suffice: they may construct the piece, the piece may be fabricated, or the piece need not be built; it really mattered little in this instance, for their teacher, a nearly glamorous woman approaching retirement, was ostensibly uninterested in their students achievement and would not mind if the worker arrived with no work at all; but that was unlikely, since the worker generally acquiesced with college demands, and was in some regards a model pupil, rarely questioning and always striving for high marks, and they did this in large part because they loathed the experience of castigation − from their parents or from teachers or from anyone − to the extent that, to escape such reproval, they had resolved to work as hard as possible, rendering themselves immune from criticism and discipline; however, in so doing, the worker realised, they had not evaded discipline, but had incorporated its logic, internalising obedience, such that now, without any semblant threat of blame or sanction, they felt a creeping sense of angst at the 86 thought of unfinished or poorly executed work, and in this sense, they realised, they had adopted the chastisement of authority, such that they self-monitored and self-punished as a responsible discrete individual, accountable for their successes and failures, for their pleasures and sufferings, leaving them to consider the construction of this individualism as they sat at their table, staring at their work and gazing at the bookshelves beside her, there finding themselves again overwhelmed by the sheer volume of material, estimating that there were thousands of books, sensed as their eyes roamed, with millions of sentences and perceptions printed and bound on paper, encircling her, leaving their unable to imagine any sort of outsidetext, which was far from a negative condition, they thought, for the library appeared to their as a world of possibilities, with each book a destination or a potential journey beyond the weary repetitions of convention, inviting them to imagine the myriad expeditions in which students, as argonauts, had journeyed through seas of alterity and otherness;",

"until it occurred to their that the video’s subject and transmitter could diverge, there aware that they had failed to examine their photographs sufficiently closely as to recognise the depicted, ignorant of their distinguishing characteristics and unable to recall any profile picture whatsoever, the realisation prompting them to open their phone’s image library, where, to their dismay, they found their face obscured in every shot, furtively shielded by hands or cropped,",
"such that whilst ensconced mid-journey the typed words and the tortured subject and their sufferings stood on their head and there evolved out of their textual brain grotesque ideas, far more wonderful than if they had begun to dance of their own free will, their cacophony drowning all unrelated, embryonic ideas, in a spectacular misery, as if to cement the worker to their seat, dumbly glued as the train thundered on, the laptop and its contents unmanned, with screen wobbling to the rumble of track and vehicular heft as they resolved to return to work, there attempting to terminate rumination and regain control, their inner commotion calmed by their conception of monotonous office rhythm, whereby the vagarious cogitations of the day were moulded to consistent, agreeable form, for their employment had the feel and look of openness, extendibility, accessibility, publicness, repeatability, equanimity, directness, immediacy, and it had been formed by clear decision rather than groping craft, perfectly constructed, they thought, to filter out the world’s intrusions, erasing the distraction engendered by journey and by home and by written word to institute a portable headquarters, erected in its implacable progression – work as form, work as structure, work as place – that promised deliverance from filth, in sanative images of profit and retail, of consumer and employee satisfaction, each generic and indifferent to the specific wares sold, consonant with the universality of managerial function, with their work – in ideal conception – detached from any particular commodity,",
"such that they hesitantly began composing an outline, typing a plain and succinct idiom and denying themself the slightest floridity in their adumbrations of colour or expression, stoically attempting a dispassionate and workmanlike tone as they proceeded through vomit and consumption, intensely focused, until the portrayal arrived at the injury, upon which they commenced a depiction of the worker’s prostrate beleaguered body, whose reanimation they had begunn to outline, in coolly explanation of its movements, before, abruptly, they paused, puzzled as to whether to describe the video’s replay or not, for, strictly speaking, they thought, it ought to be reported as a technical failure – and addressed through the correct administrative protocols – yet their inaction was only explicable in relation to the system fault, in the context of an inability to rewind, such that they chose to pen a cursory sentence thereon, reflecting as they did on the strange coincidence of malfunction and narrative, whereby the worker’s act had replayed from an apparent beginning, restarting at the precise moment the bucket was positioned, which they construed as oddly deliberate, with the idea of its random alignment felt increasingly implausible,",

const eighteenth = ["such that, with this in mind, they began to wonder why their aspirations were so constrained to the workplace to begin with: why it was that they seldom dreamt of another life entirely, without factory or boredom or scarcity, in which life was to be lived spontaneously and where there remained the possibility to do this today and that tomorrow, to hunt in the morning, to go fishing in the afternoon, to do cattle breeding in the evening, or to criticise after dinner, and it occurred to them that the reason they so infrequently considered a life of pure leisure was because work had structured their understanding of the world and of value so completely that they struggled to think beyond it; their idea of home was even understood in relation to work, as its negative and unconstrained other, and this, they surmised was the company’s intention: workers were to have life refashioned according to the strictures of labour, absorbed, as if by osmosis, in the values of commerce: the course of development was work as form, work as structure, work as place, meaning that life was left unimaginable without the spectre of remunerated employment, unthinkable without work’s ethics, of efficiency and industry, which presided over all involved, for once efficiency was universally accepted as a rule, it became an inner compulsion and weighed like a sense of sin, simply because no one could ever be efficient enough, just as no one could ever be virtuous enough, this new sense of sin there enervating leisure, encroaching on any sense of fun, such that their time at home was too contorted to the conditions of work, of which they could not help but think as they continued to affix coffee table parts, positioning surface after surface and screwing sides thereto, quickly and firmly, repetitively doing so for hours with sufficient concentration as to avoid error, though with a degree of detachment that saw thoughts momentarily wander among disparate images, which were only ever halfsketched before work again stole concentration",
"and so, again trammelled by despondency and impuissance, the worker looked to their watch and realised that lunch was nearly over, prompting them to rise from their bench to leave, and thus, after disposing of their lunch’s waste, placed in a rusted, sooty litter bin, they set off walking towards work, feeling the hard, greasy snuffle of pavement underfoot as they trod forcefully and ground fissile grit on their sole, trailing a minute destruction as they strode past the same shops and estate agents and salons as before and then halted, there uninterested in the crowd of nameless faces that had amassed aside them at the pedestrian crossing, its lights slow to change, leaving their stranded in a milieu of desperate workers and waylaid shoppers, their body pressed next to that of a particularly distressed-looking rotund and bespectacled man, half a foot taller than themself, who whilst standing with two orange carrier bags stared downwards and discharged a series of visceral and quaking oesophageal sounds, though the man, who was at this point scratching their nose, seemed themselves oblivious to their emissions and seconds later wobbled across the road, as if to signal to the worker to do likewise, which they did, semi-envious of the man’s terminus, which would not be hers and could not be less desirable than the office desk at which they were soon to be inundated with senseless messages,",
"but, then, as their experience of proximity approached its climax, as the room’s volume neared nothingness, a rumble of hunger rose from their belly and the walls halted and receded, and that gap that had closed – between subject and setting, which was the normal state of things – was reinstated, leaving them to feel small and alone as they looked to the bread and pasta on the work surface, there deciding to cook, so that, without fuss, the worker, who was long accustomed to eating alone, prepared their evening meal, toasting bread for several minutes while pasta warmed on the hob, which they ate hastily, barely tasting the food as they emptied their plate into their stomach, shovelling until they were full and sated, after which they stood and washed the crockery and saucepan and made themselves a cup of tea, which they carried to the living room and reclined with to watch the television, flicking between a novelty quiz and a documentary exploring current affairs or economics or something similar, until owing to fatigue, they decided to watch the game show, its rhythm deemed an altogether more mindless metre that would steal less of their thought and focus and would permit disengagement from the endless rumination that had plagued them since work,",
"though, quickly, they then concluded, this was foolish romanticism, for only a fraction of these books had ever been read or loaned: those which were set as texts for exams, or which came with direct recommendations from staff, like the psychology literature they had borrowed themself, so that they there contemplated how, given the range of possibilities − given the fantastical mixings of books and ideas that might ignite revolutionary fire − the reality was predictable and student life was comparably drab, its thoughts formulaic and compulsive, such that education appeared to their as little but an enormous machine of intellectual conformity: a cast or mould into which flesh was injected only to be discharged as homogenous; though, suddenly, flip-flopping, they then supposed, this was perhaps mere conjecture too: they had no idea what thoughts had been dreamed in this room or what fantasies had been triggered, for much as the same books were digested, with little deviation, they were digested in innumerable different ways: no two readers are identical, they thought, and, when they read, the intentions are different, the results are different, so is the experience,",
"and so, longing to silence the disquietude endured since reading, hoping to relieve their implacable anxieties, they resolved to bathe and to masturbate and so wandered to their bedroom, slipping their shirt from their shoulders as they walked, where once inside they drew the curtains and slid trousers and underwear over their feet and perched on the edge of the mattress, dressed only in dark cotton socks as they attempted to imagine sexual scenarios sufficiently novel to deterge any thought of their evening’s work, envisaging foreign locations and different partners whom they might watch or embrace, permitting their blurred abstractness to give way to memories of former lovers and former encounters from youth and adulthood, returning in a familiar carousel as they attempted to self-gratify, for pleasure must not demand any effort, they reasoned, and therefore moved rigorously in the worn grooves of association, recollection offering the past physicality of soft lips once pressed together, and hips struck as torsos undressed and writhed, with fingers tucked into flesh, imagined as they felt themself stiffen against their palm, desirous and pulsating, aroused,",
"such that they focused on their body instead, discernible in outline and passably resemblant, though lacking a conclusive likeness, there deficient in identification’s requisite distinctiveness, with neither remarkable figure nor unusual complexion, neither excessively long limbs nor protuberant stomach, leaving the worker uncertain of their judgement, though inclined, upon contemplation, to treat the footage as a product of elsewhere, as fashioned by another and discovered on some subterranean website, whereon, they supposed, it was hosted for masochists or provocateurs and was reproduced to provoke, or to arouse or upset, imbued with a savage riddle,",
"so that, they thought, their workplace may construct the commodity, the commodity may be fabricated, or the commodity need not be built at all, for concrete things would not impinge on the abstract image of labour, which remained persistent and invulnerable and imagined with comfort, as the train decelerated once more, there approaching an insubstantial station, where it halted to permit a handful of commuters to alight in exchange for fatigued passengers, who boarded and shuffled towards the worker, where their eyes danced over a huffing middle-aged man and their dog – both damp to the flesh – beside a smartly dressed woman whose feet were propped against the opposite seat and whose face stared darkly to their phone, transfixed in the tedium of a mobile television, which depressed the worker to the extent that they turned therefrom, looking to the cabin’s quietude, wherein the suited possessor of transgression remained absent, their surrogate laptop tauntingly present as they contemplated their disappearance, the most obvious explanation of which, they thought, involved bathroom emissions, though this seemed unlikely as the journey wore on, since at least thirty minutes had elapsed since the departure, prompting them to suspect they had fallen ill, or had exited, yet the smug attendance of the computer spoke otherwise, its foul exhibition steadfast and magnetically drawing the worker’s energies thereto, as their ruminations exasperatingly returned to the instructions beside her, as they thought of the painful ingestions and humiliations and mutilations outlined, which inexorably bleached their mind of work, frustrating them in the recognition of intellectual impuissance, which they sought somehow to justify, calming themself with the idea that this incontinence served greater purpose, in its capacity to present novelty and newness and to offer material to surmount,",
"so that the worker suspected their viewing of manipulation, surmising that a prerecording had been implanted into the camera stream, inserted as a joke or hoax, in which it was contrived to elicit their report and humiliate before their supervisors, though, equally, they conjectured, it could constitute the work of supervisors themselves, deployed as a trial, with its strangeness orchestrated to test their acumen, to examine their abilities under pressure, much as it seemed unlikely; yet it could not be discounted;",

const nineteenth = ["so they attempted to recount whether it had always been so, recalling moments from life hitherto work’s procurement, in their adolescence, when on a warm day they had returned from the factory to inform their mother and father of their new job, and their mother had embraced them as visibly proud as the worker could remember her, though their typically more reticent father had displayed little satisfaction, there informing the worker that they ought to be thankful for the opportunity and ought not to squander it through tardiness or ill behaviour, which the worker concluded was as close to congratulation as their father was likely to bestow, and so was satisfied, for memories of their father were neither fond nor tender, with their final memory particularly centred on argument, when, reclining at home and crapulent in their senescence, their father had insulted their mother and them over several hours, delivering a slurred and hateful obloquy in such a way as to have implied the two were reducible to the failure of their dreams, their ambitions of comfort and dignity that had been denied, so that upon listening the worker had departed to leave the elderly man alone, to their fate of isolation and death, the memory of which left them saddened and ashamed, yet in spite of this they recalled childhood as a time of happiness, there harbouring an unshakeable fondness for school and their early years, with images thereof before them at work, rushing quickly and stochastically, like marbles dropped from a bag, such that they struggled to focus on a particular recollection, overwhelmed by memory, as they speculated that this was the form historical experience took: the true picture of the past whizzed by; only as a picture, which flashes its final farewell in the moment of its recognisability, is the past to be held fast, they thought; so that, as they glanced to their sides, the worker wondered whether those at neighbouring stations harboured similar histories and memories too – whether images of the past flashed before them – their brains frothing rich with reminiscence, with phantoms of the past fulgurant like lightening whilst their exteriors remained stolid, labouring with fantasy veiled by robotic facades, which suggested workplace devotion and not the immanent weight of the past that the worker felt upon him, rattling inside as their hands obeyed factory protocol, the feeling palpable as they considered the disjuncture of mental and manual labour once more, as they wondered what became of such restless conceptual activity, since in the face of the confinement and compulsions of remunerated labour it was ambiguous whether it ever took root in the physical world, or whether it brought anything of substantive value, such that the worker there pondered what it might take to render thought and its requisite energy collective and social and real and material, though they soon ceased to reflect thereupon and returned to mute labour, handling components and assembling until their load was complete and they were obliged to gesture for more parts, which took only a minute or two for delivery, the workers arriving with bracing and panels on trolleys and forklifts, unloading them hastily so as to allow the worker to reestablish their rhythm and continue, which they did easily, slotting in and fixing segments at a steady rate of one unit every ninety seconds, which was a pace that was both high and sustainable, elevating them above the younger employees stationed in assembly who struggled to maintain an output of one unit in two minutes, their bodies either over eager or unused to the demands of the job,",
"and thus, thinking of work, the worker visualised the customers with whom they were to correspond – who conceivably lukred nearby – and with whom they had found themselves increasingly choleric and frustrated, aggravated by the obstinacy of complainants, who rarely relented, and at times appeared to their as if a single subject, intransigent and petulant and never sated by the supposedly soothing words of the protocol document and who always – in collusion with management – conspired to pressure their further, or at least it appeared that way, though the worker knew this was ultimately untrue and knew that individual customers were much like themself; indeed, were they to buy a coffee table or a chair or such from the company they would almost certainly bear some grievance too and would complain as others had done and would find themselves regarded in much the same manner as any anonymous consumer, the bosses welcoming their money without consideration of their daily occupations, happy to absorb their as cash bearer into the common melange of the market, and this, they speculated, was likely the defining feature of the economic order, for what precisely distinguished capitalism from the master-servant relation was that the worker confronted the boss as consumer and possessor of exchange values, and that in the form of the possessor of money, they became a centre of circulation, one of its infinitely many centres, in which their specificity as worker was extinguished, in a such a way as to afford reprieve from class relations, tolerated only in the field of shopping, where they were no longer merely a hunk of fungible labour time, subject to the constraints of the boss, but appeared as an equal of anyone, even if they were not, so that they could contemplate the nature of this deception, which operated as both fetish and progressive potency, and they ruminated on its pitfalls and promise, walking until they realised their body had arrived at the office door and that they were to focus on the afternoon’s tasks and disengage from their train of thought, which dissolved hastily as they marched upstairs, past their colleagues and beyond the reception desks, trudging to their station, whereupon their arrival they felt an overwhelming sense of desperation supervene,",
"such that their thoughts of self-reproach, of objectivity, of the function of design, of the commodity form, of work and its material consequences all diminished, quietened, as the worker basked in the blue light of the television and permitted themselves to be overcome by waves of vicarious experience and feigned sensations, giggles and gasps washing over to painlessly erode the hours before work, ensuring that they thought about nothing but the show at hand, watching until their worries were forgotten, stopping only because they were simply too tired to view more: their eyelids there drooping and their face weighted down, and a nascent headache – a buzzing sensation that had lurked under forehead throughout the evening – was developing to the point where they believed the only remedy to be sleep,",
"and, thus, they felt, that even those things that appeared most standardised, most uniform in their outward appearance, in fact harboured a capacity for otherness and estrangement, with insides cloaked from plain view, such that the worker completed their homework with a positive disposition, enthused at the prospect of a world replete with total strangeness, undertaking their assignment with care and alacrity until the bell chimed again,",
"until images of the abused and abducted pair somehow returned to mind, casually intruding but refusing to depart, unavoidable as the text enforced itself upon them once again, flashing the self-same images, of incontinent cramping and hopelessness and desertion, of blood and tear-begrimed bodies that wished for their parents, and of the eldest of the two siblings staring, again, its stale, cannibal breath spreading the stench of the molested dead as it wept, repeating, 'I will die, diseased and degraded and disposed of, subsumed in my entirety, and this is how it is, for I am spontaneity and you are order; and history will be no more', its mantra reverberant as the worker tensed their entire body in a motionless internal cry, clenching their fists as if to squeeze themself beyond the text and beyond remembrance, no longer aroused or inclined to pleasure but hunched and desperate, shaking as they gazed at their image in an ovoid mirror,",
"such that they felt misled and mocked by the sender, which inclined them to ignore the video entirely and to recommence their afternoon’s tasks, there returning their phone to pocket as they prepared to measure walls; though, without prompt, they then suddenly halted, motionless once more as they found themself troubled with the sense that the recording had not been downloaded but fabricated – by the sender – who had not self-harmed and self-filmed but had coerced another to do so, filming the ensuing degradation as the vulnerable stranger was drugged or threatened or disturbed to fulfil their fantasies, the actuality of which there struck the worker as disconcertingly plausible, to the extent that they opened their phone to rewatch the event, scrutinising its image for additional information, for traces of intimidation, or for the subtle presence of another, in suspect shadows or the soft exhale of breath, yet they detected neither, their intrusions absent as knife plunged and veins ruptured once more, prompting them to deliberate on the video’s underpinning motivations again, which, even if uncovered, they thought, would offer little guidance for their situation, for their response or for explanation of the transmission, which, irrespective of provenance, resisted all certitude, unknowable as either threat or provocation or confession; rather, its substance remained shrouded, leaving them to speculate with vague theories of purpose that, like all theories, were made only to die in the war of time, adopted and discarded as circumstance bent logic and reason to its metre with little regard for conscious control, mangled and felt, acutely, as they closed their eyes and placed hands to their head, massaging their temples, with fingers roaming in ever wider circles, rotating until, once again, they felt the timid buzz of their phone, to which they intuitively glanced to greet a message from the video’s sender, whose body bore no text but a smiley faced symbol, smugly simpering, as if delighted in its ambiguity, unyielding and impervious to interpretation, in a manner that left the worker powerless to respond or to understand,",
"and so, with doubt temporarily appeased, they abandoned thought to musings and to dreams, images of violent authors and obscene prose falling forth, as the sententious speech of self-discipline fell silent and associative chaos claimed control, the worker there entranced in concatenated questions of psychic progression and suffering, of word and of action, and of authorship and life, such that they attempted to recollect the increasingly distant appearance of their neighbour, whose countenance had since veered over oblivion’s declivity into darkness and was lost to the hollows of memory, overwhelming them with desire for their return, to quench remembrance’s thirst and to ground the restlessness of imagination, provoking them to look once again to the carriage, over each visible seat and through the valley-like aisle, to where they saw no one of appropriate age or attire but merely the same carousel of wearied bodies, either slouched or stirring, attentive to the news that train was to reach its terminus, such that bags were taken in hand and scarves were wrapped neckwards, the space beset with a diffuse and trembling movement, accreting, as if to contrast with the laptop, which remained bonded to the scratched formica table, atop which it would remain, obstinately projective and candescant to journey’s end, such that the diversion conformed to the perennial gale of creative destruction; it cannot be understood irrespective of it or, in fact, on the hypothesis that there is a perennial lull, they thought, rather, the chaotic tide of mental tumult conduced their intellectual maturation;",
"and so, beset with uncertainty, with chest and shoulders inflating, the worker scanned their words and considered the correspondence between video and text, there contemplating their narration and the status of the watched performance – in its mediation by camera and screen and prose – ever alert to their intrusions and to the specificities of the soundless image, which they had heard with their eyes yet not seen with their ears, such that its mute incompletion fell translated to a writing inescapably divorced from referent, its textures unique, unliterary though unmistakably authored, to leave a stilted inelegance, oddly alien to the lived vibrancy of the observed, and morphing and diminishing in content, with word fleetingly dislocated from function to induce an uneasy self-awareness whilst their professional reluctance persevered, causing the comforts of inactivity to grow distant, there elusive as the clock persisted, the imperative to respond rendered increasingly urgent, and its undertaking required, but unforthcoming, as the worker shuddered with indecision, wheeling their chair backward in temporary retreat from the computer, where they swivelled leftward to observe a screen-free wall, the mellow blankness of which, in all its dark painted ordinariness, they hoped, would proffer abstractive reprieve, the emptiness sufficient to permit reason’s ingress once again, whereupon a conclusiveness might return, restored in the form of salvific epiphany or a gradually indubitable deduction, though it did not, and no such denouement arose; rather, the worker merely shifted back and forth from their workstation, recurrently observing and flinching from the report, in a pattern repeated over several hours, each visit contributing the occasional clause or refinement, with grammar amended and adjectives added, though without resolution, so that its word count bloated and the afternoon elapsed, the workers there departing their stations to collect their possessions, gradually emptying the shopfloor as bodies trickled beyond the factory confines, buoyantly destined for the instauration of home,",

"whereupon they packed their things and left the library, removing their earphones as they walked buoyantly through the college to the cafeteria, in which they greeted their friends and ate their lunch of homemade cheese sandwiches and crisps, which they enjoyed and which sated their hunger as they smiled and chatted, adjusting their volume to match that of the resonant clangour of the hall, where the worker and their company remained for an hour or so, in spite of the noise, straining to hear one another in a jocund mood, allaying their anxieties and speaking only of happy things, of entertainment and of travel, of the days and weeks that lay ahead, which would arrive later, in silence and in blindness, on hot days and in fog, unravelling like yarn until one day they did not.",

"such that they there longed only for flight, from dialogue and from the day and its content, which weighed like a nightmare on their moribund intellect, urging them to relinquish the phone and tape measure and their list of jobs and to drift towards the living room, wherein they stepped and lowered their limbs to lie atop the laminate’s firm, feeling the hard of the floor as their ribcage bounced gently, thudding whilst their skull rotated downward and eyes surveyed the room, from where they viewed the apartment afresh, their vision thrown over the extended beige and its obstacles, uncovering unseen umbriferous plots below table and sofa, carpeted with slight scatterings of dust, upon which they fixated in an attempt to halt memory’s tumult, staring intently, as if determined to heave thought elsewhere, their vision resolute as the rumble of mentality persisted, unwavering whilst eventless hours mounted, their body motionless and cadaverous and there awake to sunlight’s concession before night, when blackness returned to cleanse day of its sadness and violence and confusion, with space expunged beneath the smothering billow of invisibility that swept forth to leave the worker sightless and alone, their energies intensively directed to complete the erasure, there preying for time to follow suit and evanesce, to deprive thought of any residual foundation; yet no such departure ensued, rather each lambent image, each brief recollection, reflected inwards to beget perpetual duration, paralysing the worker before morning’s intrusion, their body persistent until dawn when space returned and swelled to accommodate life’s despondency, its accent unchanged as they rose to draw the curtains and fortify their solitude, aware of their actions’ futility though resolute, pausing as they stood before the window, as if to confront the heavy and godless sky, in whose nitid limits they saw reflected the wants and prayers and filth of the world, from whose sight they retreated to return to tenebrosity and weep, there collapsing to ground to lie with eyes closed as they trembled, whispers seeping from the walls, cadent and consuming, in their strict and merciless measure, 'there is no home and tomorrow will not relent'.",
"whereupon neither owner nor user nor thief emerged to lay claim thereto, the object and its contents suspended in an odd condition of non-property and inertia, so that it went disregarded by all but the worker, who elected to inform neither lost property nor the train service of its ownerlessness – deterred by fears of misattributed authorship – as they continued to think without acting, and without any intention thereof, reflecting silently on their evening’s encounter whilst departing the slumbering train, their inner vision replaying the text’s barbarism in a manner that would grow familiar, habituation inuring them to the shadow of perdition, which would surface, involuntarily as a chronic facet of daily life, its sadistic imagery repeatedly returning in the weeks and years ahead, when at home and at work, reflection spiralling its silent katabasis with interred torment bellowed within, its cruelties unfolding in secret and obscurity, indifferent to circumstance, present when with friends and when alone,  insistent through joy and through grief alike, in both the anguish of bereavement and the ebullience of childbirth, the violence incessantly rumbling with neither reprieve nor development, such that the worker would endure a perpetual disharmony for the remainder of their life, deprived of the comforting semblance of reconciliation, as pulses of intellect and material declined all alignment, their consonance broken by a self-division, whose instigator resided consistently and contently out of view, accomplice to the power of repetition, demanding, resolutely, again and again and again and again.",
"such that they eventually gazed on images of an inert, labourless workspace, with vision fixed to the lifeless threat of machinery, whose glib form fell somehow estranged by toil’s absence, obstinately enduring through dullness to taunt the worker, who, unmoved, faced their writing once more, downcast at the necessity of decision, and challenged by the ungainly excess of the day, such that they retreatively closed their eyes, there attempting to engender the comfort of an objectless blackness, in which they hoped to find nothing but conceptless sensation, desiring the dumb intuition that was not begotten, with their efforts inadequate as thought and memory – and their conjuncture – ever gathering discourse and 94 image, and discourse and image, ever repeating and ever consistent, their march congruent with the ferocity of labour and of history, which would deny all concord and would brook no compromise.",
